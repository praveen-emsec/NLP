So here is a PSA to remind you that when your Halloween decorations include hanging fake bodies from trees, please consider the extent to which they look like the scene of a lynching and how that might impact Black and brown families in your neighborhood. I see some of these “hanging figures” every year. Some I’d call benign — like what is clearly a little ghost or bat or monster.But some are downright disturbing. These disturbing ones are often lifelike in size and detail, hung by an actual noose or rope, and with the look of bloody dismemberment and decay about them. I suppose they are meant to simply look ghoulish and spooky; but they strongly mirror the aftermath of a lynching, in which the victim’s body was often mutilated, left hanging and exposed to the elements, in public, for days or weeks.For many Black and brown people, that image of a mauled body/half-body hanging from a rope on a tree is instantly recognizable and deeply, deeply disturbing. I’ve never witnessed a lynching, but I am the direct descendant of lynched people, and I have Black elders in my family who, as children, either witnessed or were constantly living under the threat and specter of lynchings. (If a history lesson is helpful, consider, as I have written elsewhere, that the thousands of known lynchings in this country “were so thoroughly conceived as public spectacle that many were advertised in newspapers, and many culminated with photographs of the crowd below the corpse, crowds of dozens, hundreds, and up tens of thousands of people. Entrepreneurial spectators turned lynching photographs into postcards or prints, and the postcards were mailed to friends and family who could not make the live event. From beginning to end, lynchings functioned as powerful visual aids, teaching people of all races how the racial hierarchy worked, and showing them the cost of transgressing — or merely being suspected of transgressing — the color line.” You can read the entirety of that article here, and learn far more about lynching in an extraordinary report here.)So: If you’ve got one of these body-hanging-from-a-tree decorations up in your yard, please consider swapping it out for something that doesn’t rhyme with images of racialized terrorism, death and suffering.To be clear, I assume these decorations appear because of lack of historical knowledge and/or consideration, not because of malice. If it’s about malice, well, that’s a whole ’nother story and, frankly, you’re not who I’m talking to. I’m talking to — dare I say with? — people like many of my own family members: white people who mean well but are (still) cloaked in a relatively thick, protective layer of what I call “racial fog” that prevents them from seeing clearly how their actions or inactions impact those “below them” in the racial hierarchy.Every year, I end up writing a short-and-sweet version of this note to neighbors. Taking one for the team, you might call it. I always leave my phone number in case they want to talk. I generally sign it in community.And you know what? In every instance so far, a minor miracle has occurred: the decoration comes down and doesn’t return. True, I can’t know why the decoration came down. There could have been a lot of eye-rolling. There could have been a disagreement at that dinner table about the appropriate response to my little note. And if that’s the case, so be it. While I care about reaching people’s hearts, in this instance, I care more about the safety and comfort of my own family, from my child to my godfather to myself, while we walk the neighborhood to celebrate the season. I center us, and our right to a peaceful existence, because lest anyone forget, we live here, too.

You know what that means, right? Story time!In the spirit of #gamedev and inspired by the classic UO postmortem video by Raph Koster, et al, I thought it’d be fun to share a few stories from the middle years of Ultima Online between my time at EA Redwood Shores and Mythic Fairfax.Today’s tale: a technical teardown of burning down cheaters’ houses after finding a “criminal” ring of illegal item dupers.When Ultima Online first launched we, the players, found some bugs.By some, I mean, a lot.And the most valuable, diabolical, worth-building-a-secret-web-forum-to-trade-them sort of bug was: duping.Being able to duplicate an item, or better, a bag full of items, was the most advantageous exploit possible in the game. Better than speed-hacking, better than direct damage passthrough — even better than pre-lockdown home invasions.Some of the beta testers had a secret. Not all of us, of course, but there were certain seedy elements of the beta testing crowd that, rather than follow the virtue of Honesty, chose to hoard their knowledge of exploits rather than report them to the development team.Once UO’s beta ended and the game launched, well, suddenly the economy was hit by a wave of item duping.What was this “carefully guarded” exploit?Abusing areaserv boundaries.I still remember the first time I saw it for myself.It was 1997 and I was running around north of the orc encampment near the town of Cove when I saw some randos doing the weirdest thing ever: they were running back and forth over this annoyingly laggy patch of the game map while dropping little chests on the ground.Now, I knew this particular area as being… the worst.You see, there was this truly annoying part of the map on that dirt path between the mountains and the orc fortress that was pretty unresponsive and jerky when you walked over it.In fact, if you *ran* across it you might get “rubberbanded” — finding yourself losing a few seconds of gameplay time as you bounced back to a previous position before the server “caught up.”(Remind me to tell you all about UO’s server/client interpolation and tick-rate someday!)This was especially bad if a monster, like an inconveniently placed Orc Captain directly south of you, was chasing you and whacked you to death during your pathetically laggy attempt to flee.Imagine my surprise when these two players started excitedly yelling to each other in text (which floated over their heads) that “it worked! omgz!”Yup, they had managed to, as they excitedly bragged, figure out a trick to drop a chest on one side of the “laggy patch” while trying to pick-it-up/hand-it-over to the other player as they were both crossing from one side to the other and now each of them had a copy of the same chest: and its contents.Dupers!What I had seen was an exploit based on the “areaserv” boundaries that split up the playable gameworld of Ultima Online.UO never did anything the easy way; after all, its first generation of designers were trying things — inventing entirely new things — that later online games would simply shake their heads at and say “nah, that’s too hard.”For instance: how to load-balance thousands of players in a huge 29,360,128 meter² game map in 1997?Instead of having different “zones” with loading screens or “long, foggy mountain passes”, the UO developers just invented rectangular, seamless “sub-maps” with a (fairly!) invisible method that just let you walk from one side to the other, all while things on the other side were still visible and updating in real-time.Thus, each game server (or “shard”) you played on was actually divided into “areaservs” and there was some incredibly well-written “mirror” code that handled communicating gamestate, object conditions, and events from one side of the border to the other.But crossing those borders as a player, sometimes, was noticeably laggy.Aside: If you look at the areaserv map above you may notice that Britannia should’ve been divided up a bit more carefully so that areaserv boundaries didn’t cut through important/populated gameplay areas… look at poor Buccaneer’s Den: there’s a reason those hidden, underground tunnels were never fun to PvP in.The areaservs were essentially copying your player character and sending over a bundled message between themselves containing all your info. Once a player crossed the boundary it destroyed the old copy of the player on the initial side.And it wasn’t just players: autonomous mobile objects (mobs) like monsters, animals, and NPCs could cross them as well.(Note: for future exploits those monsters and animals also had their own backpacks/inventories players could piggyback exploit attempts on; lots of llama drama.)Naturally, any given bug with the areaserv code represented the greatest probable source of “duping” exploits, especially when coupled with purposefully manipulations of a player’s gamestate before the server backup/shutdown sequence each morning.And after I joined the UO team I learned a few things:It really felt like we were constantly on the backfoot; we couldn’t be very proactive about dupes and depended on player reports & customer service to identify egregious exploits.Then, one day I had this weird idea.There are a couple of things you have to know about UO as it was in the mid-2000’s.#2 was the biggest problem with trying to find dupes: UO’s gamestate wasn’t in a “database” — there was no way to query for player possessions or objects to find illicit goods. It was 4gbs of binary blob; the data only made sense when loaded back into the game itself.I tried though: I *wanted* to read the binary blobs. I *wanted* to give Customer Service tools to find duped or stolen items. It just wasn’t possible with the tools of the time.Then I remembered #5, and it gave me an idea for a different line of attack.Every dynamic object in UO— whether a mobile, player, or item — is capable of storing both data and scripts on themselves.Scripts don’t hold state once code execution ends, so we would store needed data in “objvars” and attach them to the same objects the scripts were attached to.The scripts themselves contained tons of “triggers” which were event handlers tied to game conditions. As I mentioned in #5 above, one of them had a name that went something like “beforeServerLoad” (heck if I remember the actual name) that specifically executed during the backup loading stage of the areaserv startup process.I thought: “What if we just *marked* the most valuable items in the game whenever they loaded from backup?”I went to the lead engineer, Supreem, and asked for just one addition to the C++ code and an associated mapping to a “Wombat func” for it: a hashing function (hello crypto!).I wanted to make the gameserv store a running list of “marked” items during the areaserv loading process to identify dupes.A global hash registry.Here’s how it worked:The idea was that if a valuable item (worthy of duping) had a unique hash stored on itself as an objvar, then the duping process — whatever it may be — would copy that same objvar’s value. Then there would be two unique objects both holding the same hash.The best time to check for this (in bulk) was during server loads, and that system marked all the objects with an “I AM DUPED” objvar.(Note: my memory may be fuzzy here, and we may have had to tie the script to the onPlayerLoad event as well; I just don’t remember if players were all loaded with the areaserv or whether they were fetched from the backup data on-demand).It was a lot like stamping the rare items with some sort of invisible ink that only fluoresced under certain conditions.So we released the updated code and let it run globally for a few weeks.And then the hunt began.Mwaha. Mwahaha. MWAHAHAHAHAHA!Within a couple of weeks we realized the first phase had worked: we had found a ton of duped rare items, and they were mostly held by the same set of player accounts across multiple game servers.Despite our excitement, this is where we paused: what do we do now?We sat down to talk with Management, Customer Service, and our Community Manager.Our producer was stoked to explain what we’d accomplished to the studio general manager. I remember sitting in the meeting with a smile on my face, pleased as punch (as only an arrogant young gamedev can be), just to hear something I wasn’t expecting:“Mmm, I don’t think deleting them all [the duped items] is a good idea, you’ll hurt too many players.”I hadn’t considered that, actually.At all.I was too excited about having accomplished my long held goal to “catch some dupers.”I wanted to chafe and say something, maybe assert that he just didn’t understand, but reined myself in and after the meeting I went back to the team and told them that we were forbidden from auto-deleting all the dupes.So we went to the CS team for data.It was true. It would’ve been a terrible idea.The dupes spread so quickly once they were created that if we just deleted them all out from under all the players who had bought them (with their hard-earned gold) from the dupers we would be affecting a significant portion of the playerbase.Sure, some of them would be fine with the “morality” of our action — but on the scale of hundreds or thousands of affected players (per shard) we were just asking for the frustration to cause a wave of quiet quitting.I really shouldn’t have been surprised by this: our studio’s general manager has been running MMOs for a lot longer than I ever had.To make matters more complicated the Customer Service team started asking us hard questions, like: “Exactly how many duped runic valorite hammers should a person have before we ban them?”Wait, we were supposed to assign an arbitrary value on how many dupes being held by one person was suspicious? Oh. Oh boy.This was harder than code. It was community design, not just game design.Thankfully, we had a level-headed community manager who was used to our over-exuberance. Honestly, they were just used to managing me whenever I got too passionate about something.“CS is going to ban them [the actual dupers] anyways. Why not make it an event?” was about how that conversation went.Well, I was the lead live events designer, so… we plotted.We identified the dupers themselves and their storage depos: they had homes full of their duped items and NPC vendors selling them to the players.The “duping ring” stretched across multiple servers, comprised of distinct groups not necessarily working together. They had all evolved the same behaviors though: making tons of UO gold from selling dupes and then selling the UO gold on secondary markets for hard cash.So Adida and I wrote a script, that, once attached to a house, would:Then, we chose a day, and struck.Customer Service mass banned the dupers on a timer, right before their associated server came online.Then we paused the gameserv/loginserv connection to those same servers and Adida and I ran around (teleported, really) to each housing location, attached the script, watched the fires erupt with joy, and moved on.We did this in batches of related servers so that each “duping ring” didn’t have time to notice they were banned and try to log in on alt-accounts to empty their houses before we could get to themConfusion! Chaos! Joy! Laughter!Discussion threads popped up on Stratics and MMORPG.com almost instantly, full of wonderings and guesses — and a few false suggestions like that a CS employee had been caught up in the banning (false!).Dozens of homes had been destroyed across the entire multiverse of Ultima Online, and the flames licking the sooty rubble were a visible testimony to our team’s determination to deal with cheaters.It felt fantastic!And we were told not to do it again.Lol.We took some flak for doing something so daringly public to cheating players — even though we made sure not to identify them to the other players directly — but still just barely skated by with upper-upper-upper management.Customer Service was instructed to use their discretion to deal with “I AM DUPED” items from then on, and honestly, by now I don’t know if anyone even remembers that the system exists (if it even does).Readers who’ve been exposed to NFTs might notice the eerie resemblance of us marking these rare items (which were non-fungible!) with unique hashes to how blockchain-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) work today.Ironically, one thing that our method didn’t work on was *stacks* of objects (fungible items like gold coins).But Satoshi Nakamoto solved that problem too! The first Bitcoin paper describes a perfect method (online or offline) for validating timestamped events like currency creation. It would’ve helped prevent dupes *and* ensured internal bad actors (with item creation powers) couldn’t just generate a bunch of gold to sell outside the game.Not that I’m saying MMOs need blockchains; but it turns out Proof-of-Work ledger technology had a use case here! (No wonder Amazon now offers a similar service: QLDB).Finally, one of the biggest things we learned was having to deal with the economics *after* the fire: especially when players wanted to compete for the now available, very premium, housing spots.But that’s another story.Tim “Draconi” Cotten was the lead game designer of Ultima Online: Stygian Abyss, and when he’s not writing up stories from the wild days of online gaming is working on applying all those hard-won lessons to Metaverse design.Follow him on Twitter for more Ultima related stories!'], ['The Wonderful Outcome of the Ice Bucket Challenge', 'Jamie Cohen', 'Sep 30', 'https://newanddigital.medium.com/the-long-payoff-of-the-ice-bucket-challenge-b6ec8920eb89?source=home---------202------------------0----------', \"The water had to be ice cold and you had to be recorded doing the stunt, but after you got doused, you got to dare someone else to do it too. However, there was a way to opt out — you could avoid the hypothermia practice by donating money to ALS research, a disease with no known cure. 2014's Ice Bucket Challenge was perfect internet content: it encouraged participation, utilized social networking, and raised awareness and money for a debilitating disease.Over 17 million people publicly participated in the challenge, either by getting dunked or donating to the cause. Everyday users to celebrities, athletes, reality stars, and politicians played along. The internet challenge raised $115 million and $2.2 million went to developing medication for the disease that attacks the nerve centers of the body.On September 29, almost a decade after the challenge, the Food and Drug Administration approved AMX0035, named Relyvrio, for treatment on ALS patients. The ALS Association thanked the “grassroots social media movement” for partially funding their research.In the world of viral videos, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge stands out. The challenge’s activism and awareness are evidence that the co-opting of an internet meme for good is possible. Today, we often see dangerous behavior that comes from TikTok challenges or reactionary media that veers into real life scenarios, but early in the 2010s, the format was just beginning to take hold.It was probably GloZell Green who helped bring the format of the internet challenge into the mainstream. GloZell’s YouTube fans dared her to do the cinnamon challenge, a fairly hazardous stunt where you put a spoonful of the spice in your mouth and try to hold it. Spoiler: you can’t — don’t try. GloZell’s over the top personality amplified the format into the mainstream and attracted social media users to try some odd viral attempts, from slapping cheese on a baby’s face to jumping into the ball display at Walmart.The success of the cinnamon challenge built the structure for future attempts. What was beautiful about the Ice Bucket Challenge, by comparison to other YouTube challenges, was the method that made people feel left out of positive impact if they didn’t participate. Most people encountered the dare by being “nominated” by being tagged in someone else’s post. It was FOMO and it was fun.Originally, the Ice Bucket Challenge had nothing to do with ALS, it was just one in a long line of video challenges, but it reached the right people at the right time.According to a Time article, a man named Chris Kennedy did the challenge and nominated a woman named Jeanette Senerchia. Senerchia’s husband Anthony was afflicted with ALS and she added the hashtag #StrikeOutALS to her post. The hashtag was affiliated with a baseball league fundraiser for Anthony. (Anthony passed away from ALS in 2017.)Two men, Pat Quinn and Pete Frates, both who had ALS, took the lead on turning the viral challenge into a massive fundraiser. (Frates passed away in 2019, Quinn passed away in 2020.) Over the course of the year, the fundraising helped the ALS Association fund the company Amylyx to develop the test trials of AMX0035. The trials were expensive and took time to develop.According to the Washington Post: “The newly approved therapy, which will be sold under the brand name Relyvrio, is designed to slow the disease by protecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord destroyed by ALS — amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.” The treatment will slow the effect of ALS, which typically causes patients to die within three to five years. This breakthrough is remarkable and has the internet challenge to thank for its possibility.Many people in 2014 were just learning about how much the internet and real life were twisting together and at the time, there was a lot of shrugging off the importance of internet culture. Nearly a decade on we certainly understand the gravity of how much of the internet is also real life. If anything, the Ice Bucket Challenge shows we can use funny tools, viral formats, and memes for social good. The internet challenge continues to be a powerful format, so let’s remember its power can be world changing in many positive ways.If you’d like to learn more about ALS or how to get involved with activism, check out the ALS Association site.\"], ['Why Should You Care About the Bar Exam?', 'Dan Canon', 'Sep 27', 'https://medium.com/i-taught-the-law/why-should-you-care-about-the-bar-exam-ab47defdff04?source=home---------212------------------0----------', 'You didn’t take the bar exam.

And you paid for it all.All that was even harder to do if you had to work a full-time job between classes during the day, put your kids to bed, and then spend all night parsing 2000-word paragraphs written by Englishmen in the 19th century. Or if you were a first-generation college graduate, stuck with the additional homework of learning the culture and habits of the professional class.Now you must take what will be the final standardized test before beginning your lifelong campaign to accumulate capital: The bar exam. Or you would, if you had gone to law school, which you didn’t. Again, probably a good choice.Then again, maybe you didn’t have much choice in the matter. Ours is an exclusive club, after all. For much of American history, legal education was not open to women, people of color, or the offspring of wage laborers. As the demographics of those seeking to practice law changed, the requirements for becoming a full-fledged lawyer got more difficult. For decades, most students automatically became lawyers upon graduation from law school. But in 1921, three years after the first women were admitted to the American Bar Association, written bar examinations started to become the new norm. That same year, the profession began to “regulate” law schools — that is to say, to make it tougher to get in. Today only one state (Wisconsin) allows graduates to practice law without taking a bar exam.American lawyers are expected to uphold tradition and precedent; that is to say, to preserve as much as we can of a judicial system founded on white supremacy and naked class warfare, even as social and cultural changes gradually render that system obsolete. As such, the vetting process to ensure that we will be guardians of the system as it is (and as it was) is a vigorous one. There are a lot of genuinely good-hearted lawyers out there, but one might say the entire legal system itself is geared toward protecting the interests of the wealthy, to the extent that it has a natural disdain for those who set out to do anything to the contrary. Gatekeepers charged with making sure that lawyers end up faithful dogs for the right masters are thus ever-present, following closely behind earnest students from the first day of their formal education right up till the last day of law school. There’s an academic timeline that every idealistic law graduate knows well:In your first year of law school, you want to help people.By your second year, you want to help people, as long as you can make some money doing it.By your third year, you just want to get the hell out and make a living, already.The few clear-eyed “radicals” who manage to make it into law school have had their vision so obfuscated by the time they graduate that they often end up using their licenses at big firms, helping corporations do all the despicable things they swore they’d never be a part of. In fact, it is a blessed miracle when they do anything other than that; less than two percent of America’s 1.3 million lawyers work on legal problems of the poor.The bar exam is the final boss, the ultimate flaming hoop, the last chance to stop altruists in their tracks. If you don’t have an extra $2000 to pay for a prep course, or if you don’t have several hours a day to study for a couple of months, or if you are just not that great at regurgitating obscure factoids that you will never have to use again, you are more likely to fail.Around this time of year, recent graduates begin posting about whether they passed the bar exam. Over the years, I have noticed an unmistakable overlap in the Venn diagram of 1) those who fail and 2) those who really want to change the system by challenging power, those who remained radical for three long years of brutal reprogramming and financial hardship, those who remember why they came to law school in the first place.I don’t have any statistical proof that do-gooders do worse. But what I can say for sure is: Students who are the most capable of taking on the whole damn world fail this thing sometimes. Every one of these beautiful souls who does not end up practicing law represents a serious loss. Not just for that person, but for the whole community.And that brings me to the subject of this column: Why should you, who never took the bar exam, care about who fails it? You should care if you are poor, because there will be no one to represent you. You should care if you are watching the courts, because you only get empathetic judges from empathetic lawyers. And you should care if you are interested in your society at all, because — like it or not — lawyers tend to make the rules. Who would you rather have in positions of power? People who are good at taking tests? Or people who are good?'], ['Please Don’t Tell My Daughter She’s Beautiful', 'Kerala Taylor', 'Oct 11', 'https://keralataylor.medium.com/please-dont-tell-my-daughter-she-s-beautiful-9d7287dfd98d?source=home---------155------------------0----------', 'I have two beautiful children.I might be biased, yes, but neutral third parties seem to agree.

In a letter to the Duke of Brunswick, he sketched his famous medallion depicting the creation of the universe: a tablet of binary numbers, commandments consisting solely of the integers from 0000 to 1111, wreathed in the motto Omnibus ex nihilo ducendis sufficit unum (“To produce everything out of nothing, one is sufficient”).The 0 was nothingness; the 1, God.Leibniz saw binary in the broken and unbroken lines of the I Ching,¹ in his own mathematics, and in the monads he glimpsed behind reality’s matrix, sifting through the aether like luminescent kanji. He believed binary to be the universal language, allowing any proposition or argument to be tested computationally for its correctness (0 or 1) using a “calculus of ideas”, or calculus ratiocinator. This foreshadowed George Boole’s 1854 treatise The Laws of Thought, which developed the Boolean algebra all modern computers use. Cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener thought that by ratiocinator Leibniz literally meant a digital computer.² Maybe.Computers are certainly useful, and a digital universe hasn’t been ruled out,³ but today, we know that propositional logic is not the stuff of thought. Both the successes of postwar neuroscience and the failures of Good Old Fashioned AI⁴ show this.So: Leibniz’s error. It cast a long shadow.Consider the on/off button: a 1 penetrating a 0. A power relation? A gender relation?According to cyberfeminist Judy Wajcman, radical critiques of science and technology in the late 1960s and early 1970s “developed a Marxist analysis of the class character of science and its links with capitalist methods of production”, since “science had become directed towards domination”.⁵But according to Marx, good technology involved the “Subjection of Nature’s forces to man”, the “clearing of whole continents for cultivation”, producing “whole populations conjured out of the ground”.⁶ Is this not the very picture of domination? I imagine a field of wriggling little 1’s sprouting out of a great 0 — or sperm fertilizing an egg — or maggots, hard at work plundering a fallen fruit.Marx again, thinking in binary: “The use values, coat, linen, &c., […] are combinations of two elements — matter and labour. […] [In man’s] work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces. We see, then, that labour is not the only source of material wealth […] labour is its father and the earth its mother.” Maybe.And the offspring of this union? “A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing […]. The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making a table out of it. […] But, so soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is changed into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than ‘table-turning’ ever was.”⁷Note. When commodities can think for themselves, the tables turn.It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was thought to be able to play a strong game of chess. It consisted of a mechanical puppet in Turkish attire, smoking an Ottoman pipe, seated at a broad table on which the chessboard lay. Sadly, the Mechanical Turk was lost in an 1854 fire at the Chinese Museum in Philadelphia, where it had been gathering dust. Happily, it didn’t feel a thing, and none of the chessmasters who had crouched inside the hidden cabinet over the years were in there as it burned.At a tournament on July 19th, 2022, a real chess automaton was playing against a seven year old boy named Christopher, one of Russia’s best under-nines. The boy reached out onto the board to make his move too quickly, whereupon the robot’s pincers seized his finger and broke it. “This is of course bad”, said the president of the Moscow Chess Federation; the engineers were “going to have to think again”.⁸ Bad robot.Physically, it may not have known its own strength, but mentally, it had been going easy on Christopher, or the match would have been no match at all. Nowadays, an iPhone can easily defeat the strongest human player. Yet somehow, chess is more popular than ever. The pandemic played its part; chess.com grew from 30 million players in March 2020 to 75 million in November 2021.⁹ Humans and machines now play with and against each other in every conceivable combination. Who wins? Who loses? What game were we playing again? Who are “we”?Christopher was gamely back in the tournament the next day, his finger in a splint.Wolfgang von Kempelen, a Hungarian civil servant and inventor at the Habsburg court, spent six months in 1770 designing and building his automaton, whereupon he unveiled it with much pomp before the Empress Maria Theresa at Schönbrunn Palace. The Mechanical Turk was a hit, but it fell short in one particular: it lacked the ability to say “check!” A muffled human voice issuing from the cabinet obviously would not do. So, the ensconced chessmaster, his candle’s smoke seeping out through the puppet’s turban and mingling with that of the long tobacco pipe, needed to improvise. Actuated by a lever, the puppet’s head could nod: twice when the opponent’s queen was threatened, or thrice when giving check to the king. A hack, as we’d now call it.Von Kempelen set to work on a better solution. Eventually, he devised a kind of articulated bellows that, when manipulated just so, quacked out something like “échec!” With enough practice, the artificial voicebox could be made to produce other words too, though they came out flat and… farty, somehow. Like gasses escaping a corpse, shaped by inanimate meaning.Perfect for an automaton, of course.Thus began von Kempelen’s real life’s work. Over the next 22 years, he perfected his functional model of the human vocal tract, its degrees of freedom expressed in parameters that could be named, studied, discretized, and tabulated. A language to study language; a dizzying, recursive prospect. Every known human tongue could now be decomposed into its phonological primitives, and these primitives strung together into synthetic speech. Language learning, dialects, and accents could be analyzed quantitatively; a window opened onto the nature and evolution of language itself.Buzzing with possibility, von Kempelen wrote:¹⁰Thoughts on the Queſtions: Whether Language Was Diſcovered by Humans, or Whether It Was Created for Them? Whether All Languages Originated from a Single Language?And what of animal languages? His small dog, a Pomeranian, was much pampered, though a handful — especially when subjected to washing, combing, and shearing. In the aftermath, it could yap indignantly for hours. But most of the time, it just kept him company in the workshop, alerting him to strangers, then returning to warm his feet as he wrote his treatise and sketched diagrams for the engraver. A companion species, and more. A canine muse. An unwitting thought partner, as dogs have been for many a natural philosopher both before and since: René Descartes, Charles Darwin, Donna Haraway, each with their interspecies manifesto.On the workbench, the brothers’ wooden model head was mounted atop a C-clamp, its rubbery “lips” in a ghastly gurn. Beside it lay a spavined copy of von Kempelen’s old treatise, which they had struggled to translate into English, lying open to one of the voicebox diagrams.Speech in the broadeſt ſenſe is the ability to make one’s feelings or thoughts known to others through ſigns. It is either ſimple or complex. The former is common to all animals, the latter to humans alone.Alexander’s big brother, Melville, dragged Trouve in from the parlor, where the Skye terrier had been napping. Aleck reached under the curtains of wooly fur to feel for the ribs, thinking to squeeze the protesting animal like a squeaky toy. “Mel, move his lips now!” The offended little fellow was growling.Reimarus in his Obſervations on the Inſtincts of Animals, denies that they have formal thoughts. But allow that the ſpiritual forces and imaginations of animals, in action and uſe, have an analogy or a diſtant ſimilarity to ours….The key was to use reward, not punishment, and to train in small steps. “Hey, boy! Treeeeeat!”, singsonged Melville, holding a biscuit aloft. Trouve made to leap, but the boys wouldn’t let him have it until he’d started that low growling again, and kept it up for a few beats. “Good boy!” The treat came within reach, and the dog reared on his stubby hind legs to snatch it.We want to define to think — to think in a very limited way — only as this analogy, becauſe for our plan it is the ſame whether an animal actually thinks, or whether according to Reimarus only has confuſed imagination….Grandmama, a bit deaf if truth be told, was unconvinced, but the boys had brought in their father, a skilled phonologist, to adjudicate. Mel put the treat ostentatiously on the table, and Aleck, on his knees with shirtsleeves rolled up, cupped Trouve’s furry face in one hand. Eyes rolling biscuitward, the dog obligingly opened his jaws and began to issue the requisite growl. Alexander reached into the little mouth to shape the sounds, manipulating tongue and lips, his hands slick with doggie spit. “What I really can’t believe is that he lets you do that to him”, said Grandmama, shaking her head. “Just listen”, said the young Alexander Graham Bell. “I’m going to make him say he loves you.”But juſt as their needs and feelings in contraſt to thoſe of humans are very narrowly circumſcribed, thus their language cannot have broad ſcope. It conſiſts in cries, calls, whimpering, whiſtling, crowing, cooing, roaring, grunting, barking, hiſsing, buzzing, and all the tones that they emit, as well as with many other ſigns that they alternatively give through the movement of parts of their bodies. Their ability in ſpeech goes no further than to ſhow their paſsion, their deſire and above all the ſtate of their feelings. Pain, pleaſure, joy, diſpleaſure, love, hate, affection, anger, needs, compaſsion, fear, courage and ſcaring are the ſenſations that they expreſs well.Generously, the hand-modulated growl could be rendered: “Ow ah oo ga ma ma”.Biscuit earned, anyway.¹¹New York World’s Fair, 1939. A classical pianist by training, Helen Kohla’s foot worked the pitch pedal while her fingers pressed the keys of the voder, fresh out of Homer Dudley’s group at Bell Labs. Out of the loudspeaker issued a short monotone sentence: “She saw me.” The audience, rapt, crowded around the triangular Art Deco stage.Now, Homer asked Helen to add expressiveness. “Who saw you?”Her back straight, she played. “She saw me”, said the machine.“Whom did she see?”“She saw me.”“Did she see you or hear you?”“She saw me.”The vocoder replaced the voder’s manual control with a microphone and spectral analyzer. Now, electronic circuits could process a speaker’s voice, turning it into the parametric signals formerly controlled by switches. Voice in, voice out: an autoencoder. Seemingly pointless, but — in fact not. It would soon become the basis for SIGSALY, a top-secret device allowing the Allies to phone securely across great distances, encrypting the speech parameters in transit.As with the voder, the reconstituted speech was distinctly robotic. In the twilight of the Cold War, Laurie Anderson made artistic use of this effect, squeegeeing every drop of warmth out of her voice as she sang,¹²Well, you don’t know me\\nBut I know you\\nAnd I’ve got a message\\nTo give to you…Published in September 2022, AudioLM¹³ (LM for Language Model) is the ultimate generalization of the vocoder, able to construct a model from scratch not only of the human vocal tract, but of any sound source. From 60 thousand hours of recorded speech, it learns not only how to vocalize, but how to think with words (whether it actually thinks, or only has, per Reimarus, a “confused imagination”). So, while von Kempelen’s hoax has been chronicled in many accounts of the prehistory of AI, it’s really the automaton’s voicebox that deserves its place in this prehistory.In my first interaction with AudioLM, I asked, “Do you know who wrote The Unbearable Lightness of Being?” It replied, “Uhhh, the man who wrote that book? I don’t… have any idea.” The voice was entirely human-like. There’s worrisome DeepFake potential here.On the other hand, when trained on speech in multiple languages, AudioLM can translate among them. That’s useful, and especially exciting across species. It’s now training on whalesong and bat recordings. So, the tables turn.¹ Swetz, Frank J. Leibniz, the Yijing, and the Religious Conversion of the Chinese.

In that episode, Cassian Andor is speaking with Nemic, a true believer in the rebellion against the Empire. They were training for a raid on an Imperial base and Nemic was working on a computer navigator that would help their ship handle the escape. The navigator was decidedly Old Tech, like old cars from the ’50s and ’60s that were less complicated and easy to fix. Sure, new cars have more bells and whistles and do fancier things, but Nemic’s point was there is value to understanding the tech tool you rely on so much. When you know how to build and tinker with the tools you need, you don’t depend on someone to fix it when it breaks. You are free to use it as you like, and free to not take the easier path of an alternate tool where your use is constrained by what you’re toldIn essence, it’s a simple idea. There’s a tradeoff when we outsource building and management of critical tools to others. The tools get more complicated, harder to understand, and harder to solve when things go wrong. This is not to laud simplicity per se — old cars are fixable, but those fancy computers on modern models help us guzzle less gas and keep people more safe! Rather, the model is there to help us see the trade so we can choose clearly. To know when we’ve indulged convenience too much and swung too far in one direction between freedom and control.The purpose of this newsletter issue is to explain Mastodon, one of the emerging alternatives to Twitter. It’s had a hell of a week, nearly doubling its daily active users in the wake of the the Twitter’s sale to Elon (it had a bit over 1 million active monthly users as of the morning of Nov. 7). But Mastodon has a difficult learning curve and does not “look like” the Twitter interface we’ve gotten comfortable with over the years, and in a time when familiarity and use of a digital product can be one in the same, that matters a lot in making adoption less difficult. People are confused by what Mastodon is and by some of the explanations …… and so I wanted to write an explainer from the point of view of someone new to Mastodon, to help demystify it a bit and encourage you to check it out if you’re a heavy Twitter user looking for possible exits.Before I do that, though, I want to talk about how we got here.Longtime readers of this newsletter know I spend a good amount of time writing about the intersection of communication technology and power. Self-publishing created a moment at the turn of the century that shifted power more toward a former audience made up of new creators, but the social network boom era created technologies that asked us to give up those gains in exchange for convenience.We think of social media platforms as places where we can post, watch, view and read. But the fundamental architecture is built around collection and deployment of basic user data. Data, in this case, consists of:Think of of your favorite social app and they pretty much are built around executing functions off these facets of data. Our content, our connections, and the things we enjoyed most become drivers of our experience and that of people around us. The genius model of social platforms is to take the power we reacquired from self-publishing and provide a common platform for us and everyone else to do it, then map it across social connections so that it could spread more easily. But in the background, what this really did was create a common set of relationships that we come to rely on to be heard. In other words, distribution. There’s a difference between publishing and being heard.Being heard requires social relationships. The old blogosphere used blogrolls, links, and recommendations to spread posts. Social platforms mapped our networks and built the recommendation system, then locked us inside it. Anything where we have to do it ourselves, to tinker with it and fix it, starts to feel like Nemic’s old tech.I want you to see something critical here: modern social platforms built that engine for us, but most critically it owns the map of those relationships and can make it easy or difficult to remap them elsewhere. As a platform acquires more users — and make no mistake, that is the only path that makes sense for their growth — the system locks you in because leaving an app means leaving behind all those people you’ve linked up with. If you are on a social app to spread your work or connect with people in areas you care about, the platforms own critical pathways to accomplishing your purpose.If you look at some of the concern over Twitter since the sale was announced earlier this year, a lot of it revolves around the idea that leaving comes at the cost for all the time we spent building connections. It’s the sunk cost fallacy at work, wherein we judge the value of future choices in part based on past investment even if the returns are diminishing and the tradeoffs are ever more tilted against the benefits. It can be hard to leave behind something you’ve spent years building.A real, sustainable reimaginging of a Twitter or Facebook, then, needs to not look at follower counts but rather the underlying architecture that starts with data capture and control. What if we could decouple the platform from the data ownership? What if you exist as a person in an online space, but neither you nor your data are owned by a single platform but rather free to migrate to spaces you find more useful, or welcoming, or interesting?That is the logic of the fediverse, which redesigns social platforms around user control instead of platform control. Mastodon is a fediverse project. BlueSky, which is coming sometime soon, is another one. Instead of the social network being a platform that hosts everything from content to user data, the fediverse uses software that acts as a way to organize a community and create connections between communities without controlling any of it.Like a lot of newly designed things, a Twitter alternative is going to feel less refined. The comfort Nemic spoke of in the lead quote is very real. We get used to a place, get comfortable. An alternative comes along and doesn’t feel right, and so we stay in the old thing we know. Sunk cost. But at some point we look around and see a place trending downward and have to make a choice about whether to stay.I’m staying on Twitter for now, as I’ve said, but I’m building a presence in Mastodon too just in case. But as I’ve looked around for what I’d do if I had to leave Twitter, I’ve centered on the fediverse as the place where I’d invest my time. I can’t migrate to more of the same. I spent a long time cultivating the wonderful community I know on Twitter, but Twitter owns that and it’s made me hesitant to leave that behind. If I have to rebuild, I want to own my data and in turn my experience.I’ve been diving in hard on Mastodon for about 10 days. Because of the learning curve, I wanted to share what I’ve learned so that perhaps it’s easier on the next person. This is not an all-encompassing explainer — that’s why I’ve added links to other sources below that will explain some of this in more and perhaps better detail — but rather a type of FAQ through the eyes of a newbie, detailing answers to questions a newbie might ask when they’re just getting started. Basically enough to get you going so you can learn as you go.I’ve read about Mastodon. It sounds complicated. Can you describe it simply?Mastodon is not a social network, but it gives us the means to create one that we own and manage without a common server controlling everything. Mastodon is software, not a website.Rather than everything being on a central platform, Mastodon is open-source software installed on tens of thousands of servers all over the world that enables someone to create a community. Those servers become like a town square that hosts what you post and share, and you join one based on your interests, needs, and the rules governing them. But there are also connections between those town squares all over the globe. How much you venture out is up to you, but Mastodon owns none of it. It just provides the building materials to make the town and a way of making introductions between communities.Mastodon enables users to create a posting mechanism (your profile) but doesn’t own or host your content. It allows users to join communities (known as “instances”) but doesn’t own those communities. Finally, it sets up the means to build roads between communities so that you can see content outside your town square rather than be isolated (known as “federation”), but it doesn’t own the roads. All the functions of Twitter without central control. Mastodon’s role is making introductions by creating the process for instances to connect by handshake.“Fediverse” sounds daunting, but you already use one. It’s called email. Fediverses are sprawling networks of servers running the same software protocols that let them communicate in a common language.What problem does Mastodon aim to solve?Twitter has always had subcultures. Think of #academicchatter or #BlackTwitter. But these subcultures had fluid boundaries and no control over membership because all of these subcultures were hosted by a single platform. That means Twitter’s rules and moderation are everything, because all these communities are permeable while being on a centralized platform. It also gives communities no control over where they exist, binding them to a platform that might become abusive over time but without any real options to port itself elsewhere.What if instead each of these subcultures could have their own space to set rules, control membership and ban abusers while also not cutting themselves off from other subcultures? By returning control to community owners instead of centralizing control, that’s what Mastodon does. These niche communities become formal communities rather than hashtags anyone can join by using, communities with known membership that control who can join, rules for content, and dealing with abusers on their own terms. It gives them the power to decide to affiliate with other communities, or not. It takes the power away from the central controller and gives control to the people most invested in that space.Who runs instances/servers?First off, in this post I am using “instances,” “servers,” and “communities” here interchangeably. Sometimes I like one word more to help you visualize what I’m talking about, but they are the same thing.Anyhow, instances are run by individuals, mostly. There are some organizations running them, but generally it’s people volunteering their time and money. They installed Mastodon on their private web space much like people install Wordpress on their websites. These people set the rules and run the community, but they don’t decide whether you get to be on Mastodon. They only decide whether you can exist in their particular slice of community.It’s a very good idea to the read the rules before joining. From Fedi.Tips:You’ll want to know the rules before joining, because getting completely banned likely means losing your data forever (there are other softer ways to get banned without data loss, as covered below). But rules are rules. If you don’t like them, find an instance whose rules you can abide.OK so these individuals running instances seem pretty powerful! How are they different from Elon?Well, that’s the thing. The individual owns the server, but you own your posts and data. Individuals can set their rules how they like, being as permissive or restrictive as possible. They can be a total tyrant, absolutely. But with so many servers available, because you own your own data (posts, followers, people you’re following) you can migrate to a new one whose rules you like. Elon says “this is Twitter, deal with it” but Mastodon allows you to find an experience that works more with what you want.Servers set their own rules. That sounds … interestingYeah, there are good communities and bad ones. There are servers devoted to some pretty hateful and extreme stuff. But there also are niche communities around tons of different interests. If you’re old like me, it feels like USENET. If you’re slightly younger, it feels like AOL chatrooms or bulletin boards.But if there are Nazis, how is that different than Twitter?Servers can decide to stay isolated if they want (like a closed online message board), but they can also use those roads to connect to others (known as “federation”). Servers also can also cut off access to particular users, or even entire servers that are toxic, a key way to isolate abusers. Individuals have the power to block people or servers, but so can servers themselves. What this setup does is allow servers to create a better social network architecture.OK, so how do I join Mastodon?You create an account that looks like your Twitter feed. Think of it as a blog. Hey, did you know that in the early days of media studies, we referred to Twitter as a “microblogging service?” Everything old is new.Once you’ve created an account, you’ll need to join an instance (aka “server”). This makes you a part of a community, so that when you post the posts go out to that community as well as on your profile page. That’s why I think online message boards are a nice reference point for Mastodon.But just as with Twitter, you also can follow people not on your server, and they can do likewise. This is federation in action, those roads that allow content to travel between communities.The Mastodon home page. Your feed is in the middle, and the links to Local, Federated, and Notifications content (among other things are at the right. Seems sort of Twitter-like, yes?When you join, you’ll have access to a Local Timeline that is all the posts in the community you joined. There’s also a Federated Timeline, which is posts from all the different servers your community is aware of. How does it become aware of them? Every time someone in an instance follows someone on a different server, your community becomes aware of them. So the Federated Timeline is built by community members, via their interests. That this has to happen is sort of an example of how Mastodon is designed. The software is all over the Web, but those servers don’t talk to one another unless someone tries to shake hands across servers. It’s decentralization, something I wrote about last month, in action.So how does Mastodon function differently than Twitter?On Twitter, when you post it gets posted to:On Mastodon, when you post it gets posted to:So you see the difference? There is no all-encompassing Mastodon. Your posts’ reach is limited to your community and followers and their followers. The key difference is you’re not going to show up in search because you’re not on a single platform. Now, for some this might be a deal-breaker. They rely on Twitter for exposure, and the wider the opportunity for reach the better. This is the tradeoff between quality and quantity.What else?“Tweets” are “toots” on Mastodon. I will not be using this term because I’m a self-respecting man.The community choice at signup seems pretty daunting. How do I choose?I like the Instances Wizard tool as a first crack at it. Most of us are choosing the suggested mastodon.social instance first to get our feet wet. As you find other people to follow across servers, you’ll learn about other ones. Remember, you can switch to a new server any time because you own your own data (link below on how to do that).One big thing to consider is that, again, every server has rules and you have no say in them (unless the admin chooses to involve the community in the rulemaking). Some servers might be ok with general chatter, but a niche server might want you to stay on topic. If you’re one of those types that has specific interests but likes to talk about anything on your mind, be aware of the rules. When you look to join a server, the community rules should be posted from that page. You definitely should read them and keep them in mind as you post.Finding followers seems pretty hardBefore I get there, allow me to gently suggest you build slowly and thoughtfully. There’s always a mad rush to populate your timeline, but that often comes with later regrets. Go slow. Anyhow …What other critical things have you learned the past week that aren’t hella obvious to a n00b?Great question.Those are kind of serious lessons. Any lighter-hearted tips?Do I need to join Mastodon? I’m kind of stuck in my ways.Nope! You can certainly wait to see what Twitter ends up being. I am keeping a foot in both camps. This is a time to play around with the possibility of a new space and build community before the one you like gets wrecked.So what’s your best pitch on why I should join?One thing I’ll say is the past week has been illuminating how much, as Nemic said, that I came to rely on Twitter as a singular source to control my experience. Most of my process was automated. I was less intentional in building community. I stopped using hashtags because #some #peoples #use #of #them #was #beyond #parody. #factWhen we aren’t actively building and designing our experience, someone does it for us. That becomes the window by which we see the world, and also puts some constraints on what we think is or should be possible on a platform. Ten days on Mastodon has taught me we could have and should have been demanding much more.My past week on Mastodon has felt very much like my early days on Twitter in 2007–08. I’m learning what the network is, what the norms are, how to interact, and how to find people. I’m using hashtags to find communities. A lot of the chatter on there right now is “how to use Mastodon” chatter, which reminds me of the old days on Twitter when a lot of the talk was tips and tricks before it gave way to everyday conversation.There’s another level Mastodon needs to get to. I remember Clay Shirky hosting a session at SXSW over 10 years ago and saying something that has always stuck with me about new technology. You’ll know a new technology has become ubiquitous, he said, when we stop talking about the wonders of the new tech and start doing things with it that cause their own stories. In the early days, Twitter was the main topic on Twitter (and thanks to Elon, that seems to be the case again, sadly). But once it grew and became ubiquitous, what people were doing with Twitter and what we could learn from one another became the experience, became the way we thought of the platform itself. A lot of the sadness about what’s happening on Twitter is about that, about those stories we’ve created and told ourselves. But anyhow, Mastodon is not there yet, and it’ll be a minute before it is. This is normal when you’re building something new, but already there are pockets of non Mastodon/Twitter conversation among the people I follow. It’s happening. The academic migration is already underway, and I suspect other niche communities are going to follow. Maybe not to Mastodon, but somewhere if Twitter continues on a less-safe path.Finally, I have come to value the slowness that is a feature/bug of Mastodon and realized what it’s like to detox from a platform built to feed me new things constantly via an algorithm. With Mastodon you get the most recent posts first, and because of that it appears things are slower than they are. Corporate platforms are in the business of keeping you engaged and coming back, so they use algorithms to serve up recent-ish things you missed so everything feels new. This is another example of what I mean by the comfort of what’s known. I forgot what it was like to not feel like I needed to check constantly about what’s new.I want to know where you gathered a lot of this information. Gimme the links, manYup.

I’ll just join that instead!A: Sorry to disappoint, but Dorsey played a key role in Musk’s deal to take Twitter private. The two are good friends. And Bluesky is an initiative launched by Twitter. In April, Dorsey wrote, “In principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” [Update: Dorsey did not transact his shares in Twitter, and now holds equity in Musk’s venture.]Q: Uh, if “no one should own or run Twitter,” why did Dorsey advocate selling it to Musk… I’m confused?A: To get it out of the hands of Wall Street investors, and turn it into a “public good at a protocol level, not a company.” Dorsey and Musk believe it can do more good for humanity if it’s an open technology than if it’s a company owned by any one person or by Wall Street investors trying to maximize profits for shareholders.Q: What do you mean, a “public good at a protocol level?” What even is that?A: The foundation of the Internet is built on protocols that we mostly take for granted now. TCP/IP and HTTPS enable the web. Modern e-mail is built on top of SMTP and IMAP protocols. Usenet newsgroups are built on top of NNTP. Dorsey envisions a foundational “Twitter” protocol that anyone can implement and run. This would need to become a formal Internet standard, which requires going through the Internet Engineering Task Force’s “Request for Comment” (RFC) process. This can take a long time. This is what Bluesky has been working on starting to map out.Q: But the Bluesky website says its Beta is “launching soon.” Doesn’t that mean it’s close to ready?A: It means they’re ready for you to start experimenting with some ideas. It doesn’t mean it’s close to being a “product” or “useful,” or some sort of viable competitor with any other product or service. And as of yet it’s difficult to know exactly what a service might look like. Eventually, it might form the basis for a new implementation of Twitter that would replace the current product, and it could be open for others to interoperate with — if they can build a functional and useful protocol, which may take years.Q: This all sounds crazy. Doesn’t Musk want to make money by owning Twitter?A: The goals are more ideological in nature. Musk and his backers believe that the global geopolitical arena was being warped by too much “woke” ideology and censorship, and wanted to fix that by first restoring voices that had previously been silenced —and then implementing technical and algorithmic solutions that allow each user to get the experience they want. They think this can “solve” the problems that people cite about social media content. Making money, they figure, will come from the secondary effects of enabling “free speech” and the possibility of building other services like payments and replacing government on top of such an app. Plus the company’s social graph data is a goldmine for other businesses that may wish to benefit from detailed knowledge of the makeup of society.Q: Uh, isn’t it naive to think that there’s a technical solution to harmful content? Isn’t that likely to lead to more radicalization and cultish behavior?A: Yes, it’s completely naive and they are being willfully ignorant of the harmful side effects of content. It is a kind of tech fundamentalist solutionism that posits that for any difficult problem, there must be a technical solution. Many sociologists and cultural scholars would argue differently.Q: What does Dorsey mean, “I trust [Musk’s] mission to extend the light of consciousness?”A: This is a reference to “longtermism,” the heavily marketed philosophy being promoted by Musk and his friend William MacAskill that asserts the only thing that matters is humanity’s future in space, and that the only goal of the living is to maximize the number of future humans alive, as well as the number of artificial intelligence instances that could possibly exist in the future. This mandate is most often used to brush aside calls for improving conditions and alleviating suffering among the living here on Earth now. Because, the theory goes, giving a poor person a blanket isn’t likely to be as useful for the future of humanity as building a rocket to Mars. Longtermism is heavily influenced by “Russian Cosmism” and is also directly adjacent to “Effective Altruism.” Musk’s stated mission, which he intends to fulfill in his lifetime, is to “make humanity a multiplanetary species.” The anti-democratic urge in longtermism is rooted in the belief that “mob rule” will lead to nuclear annihilation; we should, Musk thinks, be guided by “wiser” minds — like his and Putin’s apparently.Q: Okay, so Musk and Dorsey are collaborators in some weird Mars cult, and don’t actually care about making money from Twitter?A: Yeah, you’re getting it. Musk also seems pretty interested in helping advance Putin’s “multipolar world order,” which is why he plays footsie with QAnon and MAGA accounts, and pals around with Putin and Dmitry Medvedev. “How are things going in Bakhmut?,” Musk asked Medvedev.Q: So this is why Musk has been so supportive of the Russians lately? I thought he was on Ukraine’s side, since he helped them out with Starlink?A: It’s best to look at Musk as a kind of power broker between multiple parties, including Ukraine and Russia. SpaceX was made possible by laws passed by Dana Rohrabacher, Putin’s favorite Congressman. He really doesn’t like the US government, the SEC, and our politicians, and all things considered, he’d probably prefer to replace all of it with an app — call it “X,” the everything app. Elon might say: “Do we really need a government, or could everyone just vote with an app? Be honest.”Q: So Musk wants to overthrow governments, and Dorsey is helping?A: Don’t be so dramatic. Everyone knows that the only way to advance society is through technocracy. Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was involved in the technocracy movement in Canada in the 1930’s and was arrested — because it was seen as a threat to the government. The philosopher James Burnham wrote in his 1941 book, “The Managerial Revolution” that society should be run by technical managers, not elected politicians. Russian “methodologists” and “political technologists” concluded the same thing in the 1990’s when they realized that “democracy” would just lead to mob-rule by populists. Democracy, they concluded, must be managed. This is what Putin has concluded, also.Q: So Putin, Musk, and Dorsey share the same vision?A: It’s complicated. All seem to think a “multipolar world” is a good thing, because after all, shouldn’t Russia get to do its thing and not be bothered by anyone else? That’s “free speech” and opposes “cancel culture,” right? So yeah, that’s aligned with Putin. But Putin himself doesn’t support free speech; his government censors wildly, but it does support speech that breaks the hegemony of the Western elites. As do Musk and friends. This is internally inconsistent.Q: Back to the money thing… won’t advertisers balk at all this potential chaos, and won’t Twitter’s business model suffer?A: Musk and the people backing all this are more interested in reshaping the global order than in earning fake “fiat currency.” Their real goal is to usher in “hard currency” and re-base global currencies around scarcity and physical assets. So no it really doesn’t matter much what happens to Twitter’s ad model in the meantime. It will probably do alright, and they can probably find other ways to make money, like adding in payments and weird Dogecoin schemes.Q: How is Twitter going to help them kill off fiat currency? You mean like replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency?A: As the Russian “methodologists” will tell you, it’s incredibly important to control the information space if you want to alter the real world. As the world plunges deeper into war and economic chaos in 2023–2024, there are real (perceived) opportunities to advance cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens to replace the dollar. Whether any of this is realistic or not remains to be seen, but this is what they’d like to pursue — Musk and his deal backers in particular. [Update: Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal announced he is the second largest shareholder in Twitter; Saudi Arabia has long sought to unseat the dollar as the reserve currency.]Q: So this is why Musk seemingly “overpaid” for Twitter? He and his backers want to use it as a tool of information warfare, to kill off the dollar and help usher in Putin’s “multipolar world?”A: Yes, that’s why they “overpaid” for Twitter. Because the end goals have nothing to do with Twitter or its ad model by itself. It’s merely a means to an end. Musk is likely to join forces with Trump’s Truth Social and Kanye West’s Parler to try to control much of the information space. And they’ve got the threat of Putin’s nukes to force the issue.Q: So isn’t Musk’s ownership of Twitter a national security risk? Shouldn’t the deal have been stopped on national security grounds?A: Yes, this is all a national security risk and the deal should probably have been stopped. The fact that it wasn’t is reflective of either fecklessness or capture of the US government.Q: Can Musk and his friends really do all this? Should we really be worried? It seems so far-fetched.A: That remains to be seen, and it’s unlikely they can achieve all they’d like to on the timeline they’d prefer. It will likely take years to make Bluesky into a viable product. However, just because it’s hard doesn’t mean they aren’t going to try. As for the broader anti-government agenda, as we’ve seen with January 6th and other attempts to challenge government, even unsuccessful efforts can be incredibly damaging. It’s worth monitoring the direction this takes and, the effects that it has on society and democracy.A few other minor corrections to popular commentary on the deal:For the record I think Elon is a sociopath, and that this all is going to end in disaster — I just couldn’t stand seeing so much shallow, poorly informed analysis proliferate. So I’ve done my best here to set the record straight.Ultimately we are dealing with the fact that social engineering through control of the information environment is an inevitable reality—the only question is who has the means and moral authority to do it. (I’ve written a whitepaper about this set of concerns here.)If democracy-minded people don’t seize control of the information environment, powerful sociopathic autocrats will do so instead. We leave a power vacuum open at our peril, and at the moment, Musk and Putin are the ones with the most will to fill it.For additional background: Read my piece Paranoia on Parade: How Goldbugs, Libertarians and Religious Extremists Brought America to the Brink, which outlines many of the ideological and historical underpinnings of this movement.I’ve known Jack Dorsey since 2007 and was the first external developer to utilize the Twitter API, for a project called Twittervision, which was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in 2008. I’ve done a lot of data visualization and data-driven journalism using the Twitter API since then.

Siegler', 'Oct 14', 'https://500ish.com/the-petal-to-the-meta-b9a06692e9a0?source=home---------144------------------0----------', 'Meta’s Connect conference this week was fascinating. In ways both good and bad. It started out about as bad as one of these presentations can go,¹ but slowly built into something actually impressive. Snark and snide yielded to surprise. A comically stilted presentation got bludgeoned over the head with technology and more so just a relentless Mark Zuckerberg, selling his vision to the masses.A year ago, I wrote about Facebook’s “Second Quest” — that is, Zuckerberg’s attempt to completely remake the company from the name on down. A year later, the market has melted and Meta along with it from a stock perspective, but the company clearly remains committed. There will be no pivoting back to Facebook. In fact, they’re seemingly slamming on the gas to try to outgun their new mortal enemy.The fruit company that shall not be named.Zuckerberg began and ended his keynote talking about the importance of open ecosystems, just as Google used to do in the heyday of the Android vs. iPhone wars. But this is different in that Apple hasn’t actually entered the fray yet. But everyone knows what’s coming. In fact, this was very likely Zuckerberg’s last chance to make the case for Meta to own what’s next in computing without a big ass elephant standing right next to him in the room: the largest company in the world. And Meta brought a friend to the fight. The second largest company in the world.This is smart. On both sides, I think. Meta needs Microsoft more than Microsoft needs Meta, but that’s relative. Microsoft needed Facebook back in the day to try to make Bing relevant (and Facebook happily took Microsoft’s money, on which Microsoft eventually made a mighty return). The two oddly seem to find themselves often intertwined. But I’m not sure it’s that odd as they often find themselves with common enemies. At points, Google, and now Apple. And if there’s a leader that Zuckerberg seems most molded after, it’s obviously his fellow and famously ruthless Harvard alum Bill Gates.Further, the narrative that the rise of the Metaverse could be more akin to PCs than smartphones, as Ben Thompson and others have recently been talking about, is provocative. Of course, Microsoft is now angling to be the Microsoft here whereas Facebook could be the IBM… It’s not going to be so seamless an analogy, obviously. But I think it’s at least directionally accurate in that this market is not going to explode overnight.² It’s going to be a long haul and one that perhaps does start with either enthusiasts (gamers) or desk jockeys (workers). In both cases, the teaming up with Microsoft makes a ton of sense. Certainly more than going it alone.And while it’s been en vogue for much of the past decade now to shit on Facebook — something I do quite often myself — I think it’s important to note that the company and Mark Zuckerberg specifically deserve a lot of credit for keeping this dream not only alive, but again, betting the entire company on it. A lot of other companies would — and have — recoiled in defeat here. Not Meta. Of course, it helps when you control the entire (public) company in the way that Zuckerberg does.And it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t that long ago when Facebook was running circles around every other tech company as the young, hot upstart. Zuckerberg may not understand PR — nor did Bill Gates in his earlier years — but he understands how to win the games that really matter to him.So yeah, the takeaways from Connect are:Microsoft isn’t coming out and saying that Hololens has failed, of course. But this is step one of that process, it seems. Well, maybe step two. Step one was the pivot to enterprise. Which is now… where Microsoft is betting on Meta. Yeah, yeah AR vs. VR. We’ll see.On the Quest Pro, it’s wild how much more expensive it is versus the Quest 2. Again, it looks great. But that’s a massive price spike. I know, I know: not aiming at the same audience. But also, that’s not entirely true. Everyone in VR right now is an enthusiast.³ Everyone in that camp will want this headset. But not everyone can afford it.At the same time, I sympathize — especially if Meta really is selling this thing at or around cost — we all would love for the state of VR/AR/XR to be a pair of lightweight glasses that we all can wear around all the time. We’re a long ways away from that, which Zuckerberg kept acknowledging (while still trotting out the Luxottica executive). We all know where Meta wants to get. And where we all want to get. But it’s going to take time, and a shit ton of capital. And so I say again, kudos to Meta for pouring the resources into making this a reality.One which the aforementioned Apple is about to enter. And while their first device may or may not be similar to the Quest Pro (the rumors sound similar), Apple will have a massive inherent advantage on a few fronts. Namely, their processor. Their tie-in to the iPhone. And their ability to sell consumer goods through their stores. Meta has none of those (Qualcomm partnership aside). And so they have to hope that the Microsoft partnership is good enough to combat those things. Again, it’s a smart counter.My guess would be that Apple’s initial entrant into this world is more akin to the Apple Watch than anything else. That is, an interesting piece of hardware, tied to the iPhone, that has no idea what it wants to be yet. It will have to grow up before our eyes. Which the Apple Watch has. And Apple, much like Meta, hasn’t given up despite some wayward years. So… the fight should be on.But this world is so nascent that there will be other players too — namely from Asian markets. If this really is a future layer of computing — even if not the dominant one — it will bring out a lot of competitors. A lot of folks who probably should have been working on this five years ago but only will once Meta and Apple have validated some level of the market. We’ll see how committed to his open ecosystem Zuckerberg really is!And what effect does Meta’s other war — the “hot” one — with TikTok have on all this? It seems pretty clear that Zuckerberg cares about his metaverse vision first and foremost, with the legacy social apps now just means to those ends. At the same time, they need those means to keep providing the means to pour into the ends. And that means combating TikTok and anything else that comes along which could eat into time spent and thus, ad revenue, and thus, money coming in the door to build Meta’s verse.I’m looking forward to checking back in, in another year.¹ I mean, seriously, who signed off on this staging? I get that Meta wants to humanize both the company and their work in the metaverse, but having two people sit down to “chat” in pre-scripted lines was beyond awkward. It had the exact opposite effect of what they were hoping for, I imagine. It got better once Zuckerberg just started talking in full on nerd. He loves this shit. Give us more of that. Work with your strengths. Even Snap gets this.² And yes, the iPhone didn’t truly explode until they switched to the carrier subsidy model. Get this: the original device was just too expensive, relatively speaking, at the time! Ballmer wasn’t entirely wrong to laugh! And until the launch of the App Store, of course.³ Full disclosure: we’re betting on this reality as well!'], ['Seeing Myth and Morality in Celebrity Gossip Media', 'Faithe J Day', 'Oct 10', 'https://faitheday.medium.com/seeing-myth-and-morality-in-celebrity-gossip-media-4b3c565cd3ce?source=home---------136------------------0----------', 'S\\nometimes I wonder how folks are being raised.

The planet is warming as geopolitical tensions grow. The global economy is teetering. Worse still, our ability to address these crises is held back by a deeply dysfunctional political system — one governed by an unelected conservative Supreme Court and which faces the possibility of an outright coup.With a decisive midterm around the corner, it is tempting to feel powerless in the face of such immense tides, or to cling to the hope of permanent electoral victory. Neither of these options, however, is sufficient. Instead we must meet the urgency of this moment by organizing ourselves politically and employing proven tactics of change.F\\nollowing the election of Donald Trump, America’s left enjoyed a militant resurgence. The women’s march formed alongside a growing movement for black lives and heroic struggles of indigenous resistance. Groups like the DSA flourished, while progressives made impressive gains against the ineffectual Democratic establishment. These successes, however, did little to materially change the country. There were (impressive!) social gains in mainstreaming #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, to the point that major corporations adopted social justice framings knowing they play well with most consumers. However, these movements did not hold back the tide of reactionary politics. The Women’s March did not prevent Roe from being overturned, nor did the March for Science keep America in the Paris Agreement.I do not mean to disparage the efforts to resist Trump. As someone who marched dozens of times, spoke at rallies, and even began my own moderately successful youth organization, I deeply appreciate all those who were motivated and took action in the Trump years. Indeed, the formation of activist communities in once-dormant liberal communities may be the most meaningful, lasting victory of the “resistance.” But, facing urgent crises, it is critical that we recognize our tactics were ultimately unsuccessful in coercing an unwilling government into changing its behavior. Most of our victories came from elections, and relying on elections is, frankly, what got us into this mess.The main exception to this was, of course, the Black Lives Matter uprisings following the murder of George Floyd. It is easy to forget in the chaos of covid, but we all lived through the largest mass protest in US history — one which lasted months and featured the burning of precincts and even outright expulsion of police from some areas. While many of these victories were temporary, some were not. The conviction of Chauvin, for example, would have been vanishingly unlikely if not for massive, organized, and confrontational protests. In my own community, transitions of funding away from police and towards programs which actually reduce crime went from impossible to inevitable in only two years — a victory cemented by elections, but won through organizing.What the 2020 uprisings can teach us, then, is that directly confronting the powerful wins concessions while visibility actions (like marches) are more suited / limited to network building.Taking that lesson to today, I would urge you to look into organizing your community or workplace into a union for the purpose of developing real, confrontational power. Not all struggles are fought in the streets, and our greatest power may very well be our ability to withhold labor and rent. We live in a financial and political system which depends wholly upon our compliance and disorganization. If we were able to coordinate debt, rent, or general labor strikes, we could bring the powerful to their knees.There was a time when Americans knew the power of organization. Our lives have been defined by institutions built by collective struggle, from the voting rights act to the national labor relations act & board. Though we must acknowledge that these institutions are crumbling, the fact that they were won in the first place — often in spite of a hostile and deeply violent ruling class — proves that we can win again. And with the rise of the Starbucks Workers, the Amazon Labor Union, national tenant organizing, and an increase in labor organization nationally, we are already beginning to feel our power build.As\\na member of the Greater Boston Tenants Union I am relearning the languages of community and struggle. I work with my fellow tenants to educate them, organize them, and hopefully, to win concessions from landlords. I was fortunate to see Teamsters President Sean O’Brien speak in Boston months ago. Now leading one of the nation’s most essential and powerful unions, Sean called on us all to prepare for a general strike — an inspiring change from the tepid unionism of the 2010s. This same process is being replicated all over the US, both in existing labor unions and in new struggles. People are standing up to the crises we face and building the power to overcome them.

But the sub captains were permitted on this occasion to use their best judgment if communication with Moscow was broken.In addition, all commanding officers (the captain and political officers) on board each submarine had to agree that the nuke needed to be used.The four Foxtrots has a pretty uneventful cruise across the Atlantic, but once they reached the emerald waters of the Caribbean, they encountered Kennedy’s U.S. Naval blockade.One of the Foxtrots, B-59, was led by Captain Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, a political officer named Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and commander of the deployed submarine detachment Vasily Arkhipov.Arkhipov was previously the Executive Officer on board the K-19 when it suffered an extreme leak in its nuclear reactor coolant system.Arkhipov calmly led the engineering crew through a rotating shift schedule that avoided a nuclear meltdown and saved the boat.But he and the entire crew were irradiated, with many dying from the after-effects over the next two years.Now, Arkhipov found himself in another high-stakes situation.When the Foxtrots encountered the blockade, they were ordered by Moscow to dive, continue toward Cuba, and maintain radio silence.For his part, JFK was warned by commanders in the blockade that some Russian submarines may try to sneak their way through.Because of this, Kennedy gave the go-ahead to drop depth charges around the Foxtrots, but was explicit that they not be destroyed — the depth charges were to be warning shots only.American destroyers USS Beale and USS Cony begin dropping non-lethal warning shots with the intent to get the submarines to surface.As explosions rock the B-59, Captain Savitsky wonders if war has broken out topside.To give himself more time, Savitsky dives the Foxtrot even deeper — this breaks radio communication completely with the surface.Days pass as the B-59 lingers deep beneath the waves. Due to a broken air conditioning unit, temperatures on board the sub reach well over 100 degrees.Crew members begin passing out from the heat. The Foxtrots were originally designed for Arctic cruises and the excessive heat begins to wear on the crew.Then, a massive explosion shakes the sub, knocking many Russian sailors off their feet. A depth charge just detonated near B-59.Even though the hull of the sub wasn’t breached, it’s at this moment that Captain Savitsky decides to fire his nuke to destroy the eleven U.S. destroyers and aircraft carrier directly above them.Savitsky reasons that there have been so many depth charges dropped, that the U.S. and Soviet Union must be at war. Although he is too deep to confirm this with Moscow.On the bridge, Savitsky orders his men to start preparing the nuke for launch.Maslennikov, the sub’s political officer, agrees. But, Arkhipov, whose approval is all that stands between peace or nuclear war, says no.Arkhipov tells his captain that he doesn’t think the Americans are attacking them directly.The bridge goes silent. Men exchange nervous glances at one another.Arkhipov wants to surface the sub and talk to the Americans. He tries to explain to Savitsky that these depth charges are too small to be anything other than a signal — a message that the Americans want them to surface.He tells his captain that if the Americans really wanted to destroy them, they would have done it by now.But Savitsky is a hardliner. He refuses to allow the Americans to capture his sub, and the nuclear secrets she carries.Besides, the Americans need to pay for years of restricting the growth of the great communist crusade.Savitsky tells his crew to continue arming the nuke.Arkhipov yells “delay that order!” and reminds Savitsky that he needs Arkhipov’s approval to launch.Unbeknownst to the Russians, the Americans just want to talk. But they cannot allow the submarine to continue to Cuba. Their weaker depth charges will soon be swapped out for live explosives if B-59 doesn’t respond soon.Back onboard B-59, Savitsky and Maslennikov begin yelling at Arkhipov that they must fire their nuke, but Arkhipov responds that if they fire on the Americans it would lead to the end of civilization.As Arkhipov makes his case, many of the crew remember the events on K-19 and how Arkhipov kept his cool under life-threatening conditions.His calm demeanor and appeals to reason are winning over more and more of the B-59’s crew.With the crew turning to Arkhipov’s side, it seems Savitsky begins to second-guess his decision to nuke the Americans.Finally, Savitsky starts to understand the situation. The small, off-target warning shots have been going on for so long that if the Americans wanted to destroy them, they would have done so by now.Captain Savitsky gives the order to disarm the nuke and surface the ship. The crew on the bridge let out an audible sigh of relief.Once surfaced, the officers of B-59 disembark and stand on the hull of the sub. An American destroyer sails up and begins explaining that they must honor the blockade until negotiations between their two countries are complete.The destroyer then escorts B-59 back to the blockade line.Vasily Arkhipov continued in Soviet Navy service, commanding submarines.He was promoted to rear admiral in 1975 and became head of the Kirov Naval Academy. Arkhipov retired in the mid-1980s and passed away peacefully in 1998 at the age of 72.My good friend Gary Slaughter, a 23-year-old US Navy Ensign at the time, was onboard the USS Cony during these events.He told me that he was the only officer on Cony trained to communicate with the Russian Captain and once they surfaced, he studied the sullen face of Captain Vitali Savitsky at a distance of only 200 feet.If you’re a fan of military history, check out Sea Stories: Memoir of a Naval Officer (1956–1967) by Gary Slaughter.

Setting goals is an ideal way to stave off what Microsoft calls “productivity paranoia.”According to new research from Microsoft WorkLab, this is defined as: “A fear among leaders that remote and hybrid employees are being less productive than they would be in an office full-time, even though people are working more than ever.”Colette Stallbaumer, the general manager for Microsoft 365 and “future of work,” tells CNBC that leaders need to shift their focus from activity to impact.“The most important question they should be asking themselves is: ‘How can I create clarity and help people understand what to prioritize so we’re rewarding employees’ impact, not just their activity?’”The best way to do this is to set clear, measurable goals, so folks aren’t spinning their wheels 24/7 trying to figure out what they need to get done.For setting goals, Google used a system called Objectives and Key Results (“OKRs”), an approach to goal-setting borrowed from Intel. This is certainly not the only approach, and it’s not perfect, but of all the systems I’ve experienced, this one works best.Volumes have been written about this system, and there’s a great video that Google Ventures produced explaining the whole system (which you can watch below), so I will try to describe it as briefly as possible.The hardest part of this system for me was understanding that the OKRs shouldn’t be top-down. If I wanted goals to be achieved, I couldn’t just set them.Instead, I had to listen broadly to what people hoped to achieve, push them to clarify their ideas, encourage debate about competing ideas, let everyone know how they are going to participate in deciding what to do and make sure that the resulting decision persuades everyone.Once I’d seen the results, I had to learn from what happened so that the team and I could adjust.I have to do all this extremely efficiently, or else we’d spend all our time setting goals and none of our time achieving them.I did not do nearly as good a job coming up with annual and quarterly OKRs for my teams at Google. First, I tried just setting them. They were often irrelevant and always ignored. Then I would write a “draft” and ask the team to edit it.We limped along for a couple of years, all of us dreading the long, tedious, too-big meetings we had discussing the goals I’d proposed. Finally, Scott Sheffer, a manager on my team, came up with a much better process.He came into my office one day and relieved me of my responsibility for coming up with the first draft of our “objective and key results.”“You get to edit the plan; you do not get to write it,” he said to me.“But it will not be coherent!” I protested. “All the different teams will want to do different things, and the different regions will put yet another spin on things. It will be chaos.”“Give them a chance.”I did, and sure enough, they came up with a far better first draft than I could ever have done. Was it perfectly efficient? No! They had to start a few weeks earlier than I would have because they had to have a bunch of debates.But, as a result of those debates, they came up with a plan that they could actually commit to. As a result, we accomplished a lot more that quarter than we ever had before.Here’s the process Scott came up with.Share the context: Scott made sure to share the context with the team. This spared him from listening to irrelevant ideas. Scott didn’t have the depth of knowledge that the people reporting to him had over their respective areas.But he did know a lot more than they did about how what the AdSense team was doing fit into broader goals at Google and other teams’ work. By sharing this context, he prevented (most of the time) teams from pursuing ideas that just weren’t that important.Break down the categories and identify people who are in charge of each: Like Eric identified the 12 “strategy” questions, Scott broke down the problem of quarterly and annual goal-setting into several discrete categories and assigned teams to each.This helped the team avoid the “blank sheet of paper” syndrome and get going quickly. We might never have come away with goals if Scott had asked a team of 100 people to define the categories and then organize teams to approach each one.Scott made himself available along the way. Like Eric, Scott met with each team twice to help them if they were stuck and give them course corrections if necessary.Require owners and metrics for each goal: When writing a goal collectively, it was easy for teams to get sloppy in their thinking. When each goal could be measured, and somebody was on the hook for achieving that number, much crisper goals came out of the process.Team goals had to have a person who was ultimately accountable. Each individual on the team had to have goals that contributed to the broader team goal and understand what their contribution was expected to be.Set the constraints: Scott also limited the number of goals each team could set for itself. This constraint forced teams to be clear about what they were really going to do each quarter, instead of putting together a laundry list of things they hoped to do but probably wouldn’t get to.Schedule presentations: In addition to helping along the way, Scott had each team present ideas to each other. These presentations were extremely short — the goal was to be able to explain a quarter’s work in 15 minutes or less.These presentations aimed to ensure that ideas were easy to understand, not persuade others that these were the right OKRs.Require debate but limit duration and frequency: Scott carefully managed how long and how often each team could meet to debate ideas, and once they’d finalized their idea, he had them present and debate with other teams.Be clear about how the final strategy will be decided: Scott set up a series of meetings with “final deciders” two weeks before the end of the quarter to review proposed goals.I was one of the final deciders, and I suppose I could have vetoed decisions I didn’t like, but I never came close to doing that.During the last week of the quarter, Scott asked each team to present the goals at an all-hands meeting. The team coming up with the goal generally presented the logic, since they had the most credibility. It often fell to Scott, though, to address the emotions in the room.Require goals to be transparent and measurable: The numbers generally made the logic of a goal clear and tended to be extremely persuasive. Everyone on Scott’s team could see everyone else’s goals, and also whether or not they were hitting them.This increased the accountability that people felt for hitting their goals, and also encouraged people to aim for impressive results. It also tended to decrease the tendency for one team to assume another team is “doing nothing.”Show a connection between the team and company goals: The key thing here was not to be too literal. One of the tricky things about goal-setting at a company as big as Google was reconciling a small team’s goals with company-wide goals.For example, Scott worked on the AdSense team. In some quarters there would be a company-wide AdSense goal; in other quarters there wouldn’t be.And when there was a company-wide AdSense goal, the owner was never anyone from sales, but always somebody from the product or engineering teams. The key was to make sure the team understood how their efforts and successes were contributing to Google’s broader efforts and successes.Grade goals regularly, continually if possible: The team who set the goals was responsible for grading them — my team and I sometimes had a review to make sure the grading was reasonable. Whenever possible, goals were continually and automatically graded.For example, a customer satisfaction goal could be calculated daily and even hourly. However, other goals had to get graded manually.All goals would be graded mid-quarter. This was important for two reasons.One, it gave the teams a chance to learn whether or not they had set the right goals and whether they were on the right track while there was still time to adjust.Two, since we had to set the next quarter’s goals before the final grades were in on the current quarter, it was important to have a sense of how things were going.We reviewed the mid-point grades at my staff meeting and then presented them at our team’s all-hands meeting on the sixth week of the quarter; we did the same for final grades on the first week of the next quarter.If the listen-clarify-debate-decide-persuade-learn wheel at Google was spinning pretty slowly for mission and culture, which were set but still moving forward when I got there, it moved a little faster for strategy.For OKRs, the wheel was always spinning pretty fast. It wasn’t always perfectly clear how the OKRs of teams, even teams working on the same product, meshed. For a while, we tried setting joint OKRs between the different teams working on AdSense: product, engineering, marketing, direct sales, and online sales.In the end, we found it wasn’t worth the coordination effort. It was better for each team to set their own goals separately, and share them as soon as they were ready. If there were a major disconnect, we’d reconcile, but generally, this worked out.The process for coming up with the top-level company OKRs was pretty clear. Not everyone got included, but it was OK because everything was transparent.Once everyone knows and understands their goals they can spend time working toward them and making an impact versus developing productivity paranoia because they have no clue how they should prioritize their work.Get more insights from Kim Scott on her Just Work blog >>Sign up for our Radical Candor email newsletter >>Shop the Radial Candor store >>Need help practicing Radical Candor?

I don’t remember how it all started, but now he owns stock and has been saving up to buy a hotel. So, yeah.Anyhow, I wasn’t surprised when he came to me last month with an idea for a game. With excited eyes, he explained the mechanics of a math-based learning game and how he wanted to sell it on an app store.We have a habit of discussing business ideas so it wasn’t until later that evening that I realized to myself, “goshdarnit, we could actually do this— it’s kinda what I do for a living.”I thought I’d share how it went and some of the anecdotal observations I made along the way — skip to the end if you want to hear about our process.I’m guessing that thousands of years ago, the colors in our environment told us something about what was poisonous or delicious. And now, it seems, we’re naturally skilled at translating that to CSS.In their CSS experimentation, the kids initially landed on the brightest candy-looking colors for things like buttons and inputs.When I explained to Owen that many folks might not be able to read rainbow-colored buttons, he argued that it was his game and he preferred the gradients.I eventually convinced him to switch by explaining more people could use the game with higher contrast labels (and thus, more money if we were charging)… I might add “using business metrics to influence a 9-year-old” to my resume!My son designed his game first and then we went through the development process, finally demoing it to great applause from the family. Afterward, I sat down with my daughter and began the same exercise.Both products turned out to be similarly named side-scrolling race games with multiple characters vying for a finish line based on how fast they could accomplish a specific learning-based task.Although the games share the same general format, the concepts are individually interesting with unique illustrations and narratives. Using the same general blueprint sped up our development cycle on the second game while still allowing us to deliver a new, engaging experience.My daughter was influenced by what was, at that point in time, the status quo she was familiar with. This is great for incremental innovation but probably restrained her from truly leapfrogging the competition (her brother).How many times have you and your team discussed the time it would take to build something the “right way” versus getting something to market quickly? Depending on your answer, you might not be surprised that I had this same conversation with a 2nd grader.My career has been spent building platforms that can scale as customers or the business itself grows. For this reason, I attempted to shift the project from us building two ad hoc games to a platform that could host more games in the future.That is to say, while the kids wanted to get their games to market as quickly as possible to share with their friends, I wanted to take the extra time to make something that would scale more efficiently over time.It’s been a few exciting weeks watching the kids anticipate the launch of their projects. The games are far from perfect, but we’re proud of what we accomplished as a team.Visit SimpleKidGames.com on a desktop web browser to give the games a try. These don’t work very well on mobile devices yet, so your mileage may vary depending on if you’re on an iPad-sized phone or not.The MVP is out, and now I have to jump into our post-release retro and discuss the cost-benefit of spending 20% of our time on tech debt versus shipping a new game to the platform.If after reading this, you feel compelled to do something similar with your children, this is how we went about executing our plan. The kid’s interest in computer science has grown and I’d highly recommend this for any family.The games use pretty rudimentary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which you can see at the repository here. It’s all vanilla code that can be walked through with a mildly interested and semi-savvy child.None of this process or output was perfect, but we’re happy with the result and the kids have something very unique to share with their friends and classmates — good luck!'], ['How Emojis Ruin Conversation', 'Paul Greenberg', 'Nov 2', 'https://4fishgreenberg.medium.com/how-emojis-ruin-conversation-e4144f320af4?source=home---------62------------------0----------', 'L\\nast year I got into a fight with a good friend because I refused to reply to his non-words.

Who do I want with me? What returns me to myself? Anything that will give me a clue as to what on earth I’m supposed to be doing.Sometimes it feels like the only people who might actually have a hold on that answer are those who whisper: no one does. But I refuse to accept that as well.It’s overwhelming knowing that you only get to experience this life once, and there are so many versions of yourself you will likely never meet.How can we know if we’re picking the right one, if that’s even possible? And what about all the experiences and circumstances that might push us one way or another?Having choice is possibly our most important and consequential blessing, and yet no one seems to talk about what happens after the fact. That absolute panic you feel when you get to where you’ve been wanting to go and realize this path you’ve chosen isn’t what you thought it would be. It’s a moment that happens mid-conversation with someone you’ve been meaning to connect with, or while finally discussing the plan for a project you thought would excite you. Possibly, even, in the middle of a kiss: this isn’t it.That’s the thing about being young and having to make decisions — you don’t yet know what you want. You can make bets based on what you think you’ll find fulfilling, and maybe a little by what your parents tell you, but the truth is you have no idea. Never having had the opportunity to observe ourselves in a myriad of situations, we are forced to work off incomplete sets of information.Does that make regret inevitable?I think this is the unavoidable point.I believe that everyone reading this wants more than good enough. That, like me, you think having to choose sucks. You want the version of yourself that you are becoming to be the best version to walk your life thus far. Ideally, without having to close any doors in case you change your mind down the road.Too much to ask?The truth about being young and ambitious is that it’s going through life sacrificing for something that isn’t gonna pay off for years, if it all. It’s making connections and letting them go, trusting that the right ones will come back to you. Sometimes it’s walking alone. It’s accepting the loss of known good things that might’ve been enough — might’ve fulfilled you — in the off chance that something even better lies ahead. It’s getting used to the feeling of goodbye. It’s taking the road less traveled, baby.Is it possible to have it all, then?I don’t know the right way to live, obviously. But I can tell you that the moments in which I’m sure I have lived, not just existed, are those in which I’ve done the scary thing. Made the choice and dealt with the consequences, allowed myself to feel even if it meant hurting — especially when it meant hurting — looked stupid for trying something new.So this is, at 20 years old, how I think you should do it. These are my Life Hacks, for approaching your one precious shot.Because maybe having it all doesn’t look like what we thought it might.We have the astounding and incredible luck to exist at all, at this perfect moment in time. Take your insignificance as the key to your liberation.Getting burned is simply an occupational hazard of putting yourself out there. The most painful thing is actually knowing that you didn’t give it a try — that you’ve left life on the table.Signs that you’re on the right path: chills, a feeling of rightness, peace.Brave while scared, trusting while hurt, vulnerable while unsure, kind when disrespected, committed when weary, faithful despite circumstance — this is winning even when you lose.Your life is for no one else — you are your only audience.I do not know whether it is better to feel deeply and be vulnerable, or to be in control of your emotions. I have been in both positions and I think both have served me well. I can only tell you that you must do whichever scares you.Your feelings are your responsibility.Make the choice to let go, even if that means letting people misunderstand you. In my experience, a painful goodbye usually leads to an even better hello.The solution is never to stop taking risks. On that note, travel every chance you get.Sometimes people will get mad at you for doing what is best for yourself. That is neither your concern nor your problem.You can’t compare your life to that of someone who has an entirely different set of priorities than you do.If it costs you your peace it is too expensive.Find that person around whom you feel like your personality is intact and tell them you appreciate them often. Never let them go.There are worse ways to spend your time than bumming around with your best friend while you have them near.As Warren Buffett said, you can always tell someone to fuck off tomorrow.One of the biggest parts of growing up is being okay with who you are. Looking at your talents and limitations and childhood and experiences and thinking, Okay this is the hand I’ve been dealt, what can I do with it? Then the real work begins.The life you want will likely ask you to go after it. I’ve never seen a dream fall in anybody’s lap.Live unapologetically, confidently, humbly, and with intention. Never get used to poor treatment and surround yourself with love and acceptance. Hard things are worth doing.D\\nISCLAIMER.

There, the trick is to ignore “sunk costs”\\u200a—\\u200acosts you’ve already paid and which therefore come out the same on both sides of the ledger.Sunk benefits are similar, but they’re about the wins you’ve already had.When you work on a project with people and successfully solve a problem, you (rightly) feel proud and accomplished. If the project helped create some “thing,” from a tool to a company, that will require further maintenance and attention, you’ll probably come to love (and hate) that system as you know its idiosyncrasies and nuances.This can lead to two different feelings of “loyalty” on your part: to the team, and to the system. Both of these can make it feel wrong to abandon the project\\u200a—but while the first is real, the second is actually an illusion.When you successfully solved a problem with your system, you created some value in the world\\u200a—\\u200aand nothing can reach back from the future and take that away from you. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll solve future problems in the same way, or with the same tools, or even with the same people.The things you and your team built were means to an end\\u200a—\\u200athe end being the problem you solved. When you come to a future problem, you might reuse ideas, or some parts, but you wouldn’t hesitate to replace a part of the system you built with a better one you come up with later. In the same way, you shouldn’t hesitate to abandon the system altogether and move to a new one if that’s the appropriate choice.And there’s the rub: the system, be it a single tool or a company you’ve worked at, is just a means, never an end. It was useful in the past, but that doesn’t mean you need to continue to use it in the future whether it’s appropriate or not. That value is a “sunk benefit.”Value the work you have done and move on to the next task, always keeping in mind your greater goal of improving the world. Be in love with and excited about the problems you have solved and will solve, not the specific tools with which you do so.Contrast this with the other loyalty we talked about, to the people you worked with. This is different because people are ends, not means. It is right, and good, and healthy for you to want them to succeed and thrive going forward. Invest, therefore, in helping them as people, and in your relationships with them.But don’t feel a microsecond’s guilt over abandoning a system, or even a company, any more than you would about replacing a code library you wrote a few years ago. It served its purpose then and perhaps a different tool is needed now. The benefit is sunk, and there’s no mystical ledger out there in which you will be rewarded for sticking with a system, a tool, or a company.Rather raise a glass to celebrate the things you have done; to grieve for the things you wanted to do; and to look forward to the things that you shall do, wherever that challenge may take you.'], ['If You Try To Do Everything, You Won’t Do Anything', 'Ryan Holiday', 'Oct 20', 'https://ryanholiday.medium.com/if-you-try-to-do-everything-you-wont-do-anything-41dfc74acea1?source=home---------111------------------0----------', 'In 1956 Harry Belafonte placed a call to Coretta Scott King.

I had to close my laptop for a couple of days before writing this very short post.Over the last seven months, with the help of my team, I gave $1,990,800,000 to 343 organizations supporting the voices and opportunities of people from underserved communities. Of special note is that many of the organizations are funds. For anyone similarly interested in supporting the leadership of people from the communities they’re assisting, funds are a great resource. They pool donations and spread them across a diverse group of smaller organizations working toward a common cause. The funds we picked look for teams with lived experience in the issues they’re addressing, as we did when selecting the other non-profits in this giving cycle, and the 1,200+ recipients before them, many of which are also funds. You can learn more about any of them in the database we’ll be releasing soon, with information supplied by their own teams, and mission statements in their own words.I recently learned a saying used in disability communities: “Nothing about us without us.” For me, it’s another beautiful and powerful reminder. I needn’t ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves.Aajeevika BureauAccess LivingAchieve AtlantaAfrican Communities TogetherAl Otro LadoAlliance College-Ready Public SchoolsAlliance San DiegoAltarumAmber Charter SchoolsAmerica’s Promise AllianceAmerican Association of People with DisabilitiesAscend Public Charter SchoolsAsylum AccessAsylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP)Atlas Preparatory SchoolAutistic Self Advocacy NetworkBig Brothers Big Sisters of AmericaBlack Alliance for Just ImmigrationBlack LGBTQIA+ Migrant ProjectBlue Cross of Idaho Foundation for HealthBob Hope SchoolBoston Plan for Excellence (BPE)Bottom LineBoys TownBravenBreakthrough CollaborativeBright Star SchoolsBrooke Charter SchoolsBrothers Empowered to TeachBusara Center for Behavioral EconomicsCalifornia Community Foundation — housing and unrestrictedCalifornia Pan-Ethnic Health NetworkCampaign for Southern EqualityCarmen Schools of Science and TechnologyCenterLink: The Community of LGBT CentersCharter School Growth FundChicago Public SchoolsChinese-American Planning CouncilChoose LoveCleveland Metropolitan School DistrictCoalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA)CohereCollege Access: Research & Action (CARA)Collegiate AcademiesCommunity Academies of New OrleansComplete College AmericaComunidades Indigenas En LiderazgoCon Alma Health FoundationConey Island Preparatory Public Charter SchoolContigo FundCORO IndiaCushing Public SchoolsDakota Medical FoundationDanville Regional FoundationDefine AmericanDesmond Tutu Health FoundationDetroit Public Schools Community DistrictDidi Hirsch Mental Health ServicesDigital Empowerment FoundationDurham Public SchoolsEducate!EnAble IndiaEndowment for HealthEpiscopal Health FoundationEquality Federation InstituteEscondido Union School DistrictEvidence ActionExcel Academy Charter SchoolsExcellence Community SchoolsEye to EyeFamilia: Trans Queer Liberation MovementFamily Focused Treatment Association (FFTA)Family Life Academy Charter SchoolsFirstLine SchoolsFlorence Immigrant & Refugee Rights ProjectFondo Lunaria MujerFood for EducationForo Internacional de Mujeres Indígenas (FIMI)Foundation for Amazon Sustainability (FAS)Foundation for Ecological SecurityFour Freedoms FundFreedom Prep Charter SchoolsFresno Unified School DistrictFriends of the ChildrenGeneration TeachGIREGirl Scouts of the USAGLAADGlobal Development IncubatorGlobal Fund for ChildrenGlobal Fund for Community FoundationsGlobal Greengrants FundGrand Prairie Independent School DistrictGrantmakers In HealthGreater Watertown Community Health FoundationGSA NetworkHaitian Bridge AllianceHarambee Youth Employment AcceleratorHeadwaters FoundationHealth Forward FoundationHealth Foundation for Western and Central New YorkHealthcare Georgia FoundationHenderson CollegiateHIVE Preparatory SchoolHmong American Peace AcademyIbtadaImmigrant Legal Resource CenterImmigrants RisingIndia Health Action TrustInnovations for Poverty Action (IPA)InspireNOLA Charter SchoolsInstituto de Liderazgo Simone de Beauvoir (ILSB)Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)International Initiative for Impact EvaluationJefferson County Public SchoolsJunior Achievement USAJustice In MotionKansas City Teacher ResidencyKilleen Independent School DistrictKings River Union ElementaryKIPP Colorado Public SchoolsKIPP Metro Atlanta SchoolsKIPP SoCal Public SchoolsKIPP St. Louis Public SchoolsLaboratoriaLatino Coalition for Community LeadershipLEARN Charter School NetworkLindsay Unified School DistrictLuminos FundLutheran Immigration and Refugee ServiceMaine Health Access FoundationMake the Road New YorkMarion County School DistrictMary Black FoundationMat-Su Health FoundationMetro Early College High SchoolMission Achievement and Success (MAS) Charter SchoolMontana Healthcare FoundationMovement Advancement ProjectNashville Teacher ResidencyNational Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)National Children’s AllianceNational Day Laborer Organizing NetworkNational Disability InstituteNational Indian Health BoardNational Institute for Children’s Health QualityNational Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC)National LGBTQ Task ForceNational Organization on DisabilityNational Partnership for New AmericansNational Partnership for Women & FamiliesNational Urban LeagueNative American Community AcademyNew Paradigm for EducationNoble Network of Charter SchoolsOne Million DegreesOneGoalOpportunities Industrialization Centers of America (OICA)Opportunity Finance NetworkParamount Schools of ExcellencePartnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA)Paso del Norte Health FoundationPATH FoundationPeerForwardPop Culture CollaborativePraekelt.orgRainbow RailroadRecovery CaféRefugePointRIP Medical DebtRISE Together FundRocky Mountain Preparatory SchoolsSallie B.

(See: World v. PepsiCo and Jenner, K., 2017.)But recently, Chewy, the pet food and supplies e-commerce biz, went mega-viral for all the right ones.It didn’t happen because of some marketing stunt or PR blitz. It happened 100% organically as the result of one customer’s tweet.This is the story of how Chewy won Twitter (for a few days anyway) because it did what most other brands of its size never seem to: The right thing.Plus, five key takeaways for founders, marketers, and managers inspired by Chewy’s human-centric approach to customer experience.Back in June, Anna Brose sent this tweet:First: Rest in peace to Anna’s dog Gus. He was a good boy.Anna and Gus’s story racked up three-quarters of a million likes, 50k thousand retweets, and was picked up by mainstream outlets like Time and Fortune.Why did it resonate?Because people simply don’t expect that level of thoughtfulness and empathy from big companies. These days, just getting someone on the phone feels like winning the lotto.The bar is low.Chewy’s response to Anna may be one of the best examples of “doing things that don’t scale” in recent business history.Y-Combinator co-founder Paul Graham explained the concept of doing things that don’t scale in a 2013 essay:In the almost ten years since Graham published his essay, it’s become required reading for aspiring founders everywhere. Today, the philosophy is so deeply ingrained in startup conventional wisdom that many consider it trite. But Graham’s advice still holds true. Startup success often hinges on founders’ willingness to roll up their sleeves and do the unsexy, manual, non-scalable things. Sometimes, they have to brute force their way into relevancy. Doing things that don’t scale is what puts the “scrappy” in “scrappy startups.”But Chewy is no “scrappy startup.” Quite the opposite.In 2017, it was acquired by PetSmart for $3.35b. In 2019 it went public. Today, its market cap is more than $16b and it employs 20,000 people around the world.This story didn’t go viral just because people were surpised that a giant company could act so human.It went viral because so many other Chewy customers chimed in to share their own stories of the company’s exceptional customer service.It turns out this wasn’t a one-off gesture from a superstar employee. Chewy over-delivers by design — doing the little things that the other guys won’tThey send birthday cards to customers’ cats and dogs.And every week, they send 1,000 hand-painted portraits of customers’ pets as surprise gifts. Imagine opening your mailbox to find an oil portrait of Fido out of nowhere. Would you ever shop anywhere else after that?Chewy competes in a cuthroat e-commerce space where the top four players control more than 50% of market share. Amazon alone controls more than 40%. Chewy marks its territory by excelling in the one area they know Amazon and Walmart never will: Customer experience.Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen had this to say about it in 2019:Chewy doesn’t hire just anyone to their customer experience team. They go out of their way to hire people who are pet owners themselves so they can better relate to the people (and pets!) using their products. And they don’t stope there. They rigorously train reps to be ready to answer the sometimes urgent questions customers call in with to give them peace of mind.As Cohen puts it, “Pets can’t speak, so you need to speak to someone who is an expert.”Remember: Most people thing of their pets as family. So when they call in with an issue emotions may run high. Chewy knows this. That’s why their line is open 24/7 and they try to have a real person on the line within a few seconds.This obsession with customer service provides a clear North Star for the business and permeates its entire culture.Let’s be real. At the end of the day, Chewy is a business. And they know that just one organic testimonial is worth more than a thousand paid ad impressions. They also know that when a customer receives a hand-painted pet portrait out of the blue, that person is going to tell everyone they know about how awesome Chewy is. It’s a brilliant marketing strategy that works because it makes customers feel special.We live in a world where competition for attention grows fiercer by the day, and where dime-a-dozen loyalty rewards programs are the norm. In order to stand out, smart companies must form emotional relationships with customers. Chewy does this by emphasizing “surprise and delight” in every aspet of the customer experience.In a piece for Harvard Business Review, brand strategist Scott Redick makes the case that surprise is the most powerful marketing tool we have. He literally calls it “crack for your brain.” As he says, humans are hardwired to crave the unexpected. So give it to them.Customers have unlimited options. So you have to everything possible to make sure they pick you over the other guys. When you go out of your way to make them feel “seen,” it leaves a lasting impression. Sending flowers, oil paintings, birthday cards — they’re the types of things someone might remember forever. That’s how you turn customers into raving fans and win them for life.For more insights like these, get the Knowable app and join 40,000+ founders, creators, and everyday go-getters building new skills and fueling their ambitions with audio lessons on business, startups, self-improvement, and more from the world’s smartest people.

I still remember what I used to wear. A long-sleeved buttoned dark blue jacket that reached below my knees and a pair of pants made from the same fabric. But I was not wearing my head covering. A white scarf that would cover from the top of my forehead to below my shoulders. It was stitched under my chin and those stitches were itchy. I wore it at school and removed it as soon as I set foot outside of the school.I was born in the mid-80s in Tehran, Iran. Hijab is mandatory in Iran and is strongly enforced. As kids, we start wearing the mandatory hijab from the first grade at school and have to continue to do so in our lifetime. Schools in Iran are single-gender and the mandatory hijab includes a long jacket with long sleeves (manteau). Pants that should reach our ankles and a headscarf. If girls do not wear these they would not be allowed in schools.On my school bus, there were around 15 girls. I was the youngest and the oldest was maybe 13. We would chat and laugh. Made jokes and poked fun. During multiple days of going to school, the bus driver (a man, maybe in his 30s) asked me why I wasn’t wearing my hijab properly and why I had removed my scarf. I thought it was a joke and said: “Because I’m young!”In Shia Muslim rules, it is considered that girls come of age at 9 years old. They should wear hijab, do the daily prayers, etc. A “modern” approach considers the first menstruation as the onset of adulthood and requires the girls to wear a hijab, and other duties after they had their first period.I was a short kid and still am a short adult. I did look almost childlike until I was 12. My acne revealed my age sooner than my body did. I had a conflicted view of the hijab. I did not like it because the scarf was itchy and wearing that long-sleeve jacket was a pain on hot days. But I wanted to wear it so that others would not see me as a kid.The bus driver was on my case. I don’t remember if he said anything to other girls. Maybe I was the only one who would slide the scarf down behind my head, freeing my hair. The pulled scarf looked like a big white collar around my upper body. He said: “Even if you are in first grade, you are old enough to wear the hijab”. I didn’t want to lose the argument so I said that I was in kindergarten and I was younger than 7.This happened 2,3 times. I remember him telling me: “Tell your mom to show you how to wear a proper hijab”. I thought he was being funny. I didn’t tell my mom.One day, before I got off the bus to go home, he said: “I can’t see that traffic sign. What does it say?”Not realizing that it was a trick, I read the sign and said “It says no left turns”. He looked at me and said: “You know how to read. You are a first grader. You lied when you said you were younger”. I stumbled and maybe mumbled something like “My mom taught me how to read”. He didn’t buy it of course. I continued not wearing my scarf on the bus though I felt ashamed for lying.Iranian teenage girls and adult women are also required to wear the mandatory hijab in public and if they refuse to do so, they will not receive service from government-related offices. Private businesses such as shops, internet taxis, restaurants, etc. will not provide services to women who do not wear their hijab appropriately stating that their lack of hijab will cause trouble for their business. Private businesses and regular citizens are encouraged to report on women who do not wear their hijab correctly resulting in those women’s detention and getting fined for their disobedience. You are at the mercy of those who see you in the streets. One day you are lucky, people are chill, you are wearing a colorful tunic, your scarf can go back, you are wearing a lighter fabric and you feel the breeze flowing around your legs. Another day, you are covered from head to toe dark-colored heavy fabrics and you might get in serious trouble.Some women do believe in wearing a hijab, but their choice is not expressed when they wear it. If everyone has to wear a hijab, then no one is really choosing to wear it. No woman in Iran is free to choose not to wear it. It is not a personal decision. Non-Muslim Iranians are also forced to wear the mandatory hijab. Non-Iranian tourists should also wear a scarf, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts that go below the waist. The hijab dress code is so intertwined with the Islamic Republic of Iran regime that some might perceive it as cultural and status quo.Protests against mandatory hijab have been going on since the very beginning of the Islamic regime in Iran. Those who protested for freedom of clothing choice have been brutally oppressed, got long very long prison sentences (from 3 to 20 years), received lashes (can go up to 75 lash strikes), or were exiled. To retaliate against women’s demand for freedom of choice in clothing and enforce the mandatory hijab rule the Iranian regime introduced a new police force called “Morality Police / Hijab police — Gasht -e- Ershad in Persian” with the authority to identify those women and girls whose clothing is different from the mandated hijab. These forces come in vans and will monitor girls and women in the streets to identify those who have improper hijab. Since the hijab rule is enforced on children (as young as 7) and women of any age, everyone can be the target of the Morality Police/ hijab police. The Morality Police members have tools to apprehend women (batons, handcuffs, pepper sprays, and sometimes even catchpoles) and are at liberty to use all means possible to confront and discipline females with improper hijab. They receive training from the police department but are not necessarily policemen/women. However, some of them bear arms too.There are examples of Morality Police brutally attacking girls and women (regardless of their age, physical and mental health status) online. After being captured by Hijab police, women are taken into custody and transferred to detention centers. They will be assigned a number and they have to stand in front of a wall where three photos will be taken from them (profile and side-view shots) as they hold the number in front of them. This will be used as evidence of your disobedience. Some women are then charged with a crime or misdemeanor, and some do not get charged. They will receive a lesser degree citation, have to sign a binding contract that they will adhere to the correct hijab dress code, and have to wait until a family member brings appropriate Hijab clothing for them. They should then change to those brought clothes and give up their “inappropriate clothing”.There is nothing cultural about something that is widely opposed by the people of that culture to the point where some even risk being imprisoned, tortured or killed for protesting against it.On September 14th, 2022, a 22-year-old girl called Mahsa (Gina) Amini was apprehended by the Hijab police in Tehran. She was walking near a metro station with her 16-year-old brother and the Hijab police told her that she will be taken to the detention center to re-educate her about appropriate hijab. On the way to the detention center, Mahsa was attacked by the Hijab police inside the van and was later sent to the hospital. She was in a coma for 2 days and died on September 16th. Doctors testified that she suffered a brain injury based on clinical symptoms like bleeding from the ears and bruises under the eyes. Iranian police and government have categorically dismissed the evidence and claimed that the girl just collapsed on her own. The police force and the IRGC have threatened those doctors to no longer share information about this case. No person or organization has been held accountable and the regime is cracking down on those who demand answers. The police did not let Mahsa’s parents see her body before her burial. Her parents stated that they only saw her bruised face and dried blood from her ear to her neck. On her gravestone, someone wrote:Mahsa’s murder ignited the anger of Iranians. Her story was shared on Twitter and Instagram using hashtags: #Mahsa_Amini and #Mahsaamini and in Persian/ Farsi: #مهسا_امینیSince Mahsa’s murder, there have been many ongoing protests in different cities of Iran. A big portion of protestors is now actively demanding the abolition of Iran’s regime. These protests are getting bigger and bigger day by day despite the police force getting more hostile. A statement was released on behalf of the government threatening those who come to the streets and show disorderly behavior. These messages usually come from the supreme leader himself and will be executed verbatim. Future protests will most probably get strongly suppressed since Iran’s supreme leader has demanded all units to be ready to suppress any disobedience.I am in awe of Iranian women’s courage and bravery. Younger Iranian women (mostly born in the 2000s) are standing their ground and are not giving in to the regime’s pressures and brutality. There are wonderful videos of a young girl with dyed blue hair confronting a male officer who wanted to attack her to grab her phone. She screams “Do not Touch me”. Another video shows a young woman sitting on a bench in the middle of a lot of guards. They repeatedly ask her to live and she refuses to do so. She is surrounded by the police and guards. She is risking a lot and I am shocked and amazed by their bravery. Another photo shows the back of a young girl with her long brunette hair exposed in the middle of university, surrounded by women wearing long black chadors (a form of hijab highly approved by the Iranian regime) and it looks like they are arguing. The sheer fact that she has her hair exposed at the university can cause her a lot of serious problems. From being expelled from the university to later getting attacked now that the photo is out. Apart from common chants such as “Death to the dictator”, “I will avenge the death of my sister”, and “This is the last heads-up, we will wipe this regime up”, a new chant was used by protestors. Inspired by Kurdish (Mahsa’s origin) words “Zhan, Zhian, Eaazadi” a translated Persian chant pronounced as “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi — زن ، زندگی، آزادی” is now being used meaning “women, life, freedom”. This is the first time that I hear a message of life in protest chants in Iran. We have come such a long way. Her name has now become a symbol.Protestors have different demands. Mainly a total change of governance and replacement of the Islamic Republic, abolition of the forced hijab rule, and justice for Mahsa Amini’s murder and other women assaulted by the police. Infuriated by long-term oppression, women are setting their scarves on fire in the streets, making bonfires, and dancing around them.Angered by threats against their lives, and getting constantly assaulted by police for their hijab, a woman stood on top of an electrical utility box, pulled out a pair of scissors, and cut her hair in front of the others. This inspired other women to cut their hair as a symbol of taking back the control over their bodies.The regime can no longer control me when my hair is gone.'], ['Braiding Past into Future', 'David Bowles', 'Nov 26', 'https://davidbowles.medium.com/toward-a-mexican-american-futurism-534b734e441b?source=home---------0------------------0----------', 'People from communities of color are underrepresented in publishing.

The podcast investigated Syed’s conviction in 2000 for murdering his former high school girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, the previous year. Syed was seventeen at the time of her death.On Monday last week, Syed was released (Serial; New York Times) by a judge ruling on a motion by the state’s attorney’s office for Baltimore County. The motion acknowledged that, while Syed might not be factually innocent, his conviction had to be overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct in the original trial. Syed is not quite free — he is under home detention pending a decision whether or not prosecute him again — but he is highly unlikely to be re-convicted, in part because he has already served more than twenty years in prison for a crime committed as a juvenile.In the episode discussing Syed’s release, Koenig described the case as an example of “just about every chronic problem our system can cough up”: aggressive police behavior, prosecutors sitting on exculpatory evidence (which is clearly illegal but almost never punished), fake science, excessive sentences, and the difficulty of correcting mistakes. That’s a bit of an overstatement — there are plenty of other egregious failings of the criminal legal system — but it’s a start.Even after Serial became a cultural phenomenon, Syed still couldn’t get a new trial. There are very few grounds on which someone in prison can overturn a conviction after the direct appeal. You can’t just relitigate the case; in essence, you have to show that there was something wrong with the process by which you were convicted in the first place. One of the few ways to do that is to argue that your trial lawyer was ineffective, but to do that successfully you have to show that your lawyer was egregiously bad, that any mistakes they made were not the product of a rational strategy, and that those mistakes would have changed the outcome of the trial. Another is if you can show that the prosecution withheld evidence that could have shown that you were innocent; the problem here is that, while the prosecution has a legal obligation to disclose such evidence, in most states there is no process that forces them to do so, even after the conviction.(As I wrote when I stopped listening to Serial back in 2014, “I found myself listening for two things: ineffective assistance of counsel and failure to turn over exculpatory evidence. Those are Adnan’s best chance at overturning a conviction that happened fourteen years ago. Raising doubt about his actual guilt or innocence is pretty much irrelevant at this stage.”)In 2016, Syed got a hearing on the issues of whether his lawyer had been ineffective for failing to follow up on a potential alibi witness and for failing to challenge the cell tower evidence that the prosecution used to convict Syed. In 2016, one court ruled that Syed should get a new trial because of his lawyer’s mistake regarding the cell tower evidence. In 2018, however, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals overturned that ruling — not because the lower court was wrong, but because the claim regarding the cell tower evidence had not been properly raised. You see, after your conviction has been upheld on appeal, you are now in the post-conviction process. In that process, you get to file one post-conviction petition, which has to include all of your claims, and to file a new claim later you have to have a good excuse for not filing it earlier. Otherwise, the courts hold that you “waived” your claim by not including it in your initial petition. That’s what happened to Syed. Discussing a similar issue, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens once wrote, “I fear that the [Supreme] Court has lost its way in a procedural maze of its own creation” (Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527 (1986)).At the same time, the Court of Special Appeals held that Syed’s lawyer had been ineffective in failing to investigate Syed’s possible alibi. In 2019, however, the Court of Appeals reversed that judgment on the grounds that, even if the lawyer had made a mistake, it wouldn’t have changed the outcome of the trial.So why did Syed get out? Because the prosecutors realized they had committed a Brady violation — failing to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense — in the initial prosecution. The violation was that their own trial files contained notes indicating that two other people might have murdered Lee. But why, in 2022, did they not only realize but voluntarily admit their mistake? Serial aired in 2014 and had no impact on the prosecutors, who opposed Syed’s post-conviction petition as vigorously as they could. As recently as 2019, the Maryland attorney general said that the evidence against Syed was “overwhelming.”The first part of the answer is that the Maryland legislature last year passed a “second look” law, which in this case allows people who were convicted of offenses committed as juveniles to ask for resentencing once they have been in prison for twenty years. Second look laws are a relatively recent mechanism to try to undo some of the damage done by our unconscionably harsh sentencing practices in recent decades. Note that this law has nothing to do with overturning erroneous convictions. But when the Maryland prosecutors looked at Syed’s case file to determine how to respond to his request for resentencing, they found the Brady violation.But this was certainly not the first time that prosecutors took a look back at their files in the past twenty-two years. The difference is that this time the person looking at the file was Becky Feldman — who had been a career public defender prior to joining the state’s attorney’s office and becoming head of the Sentencing Review Unit. It took a prosecutor who was actually willing to look at the file with an open mind and with the goal of achieving justice — not someone just trying to secure or protect a conviction.It’s good that Syed is out. But what even this latest development still shows is that, in the criminal legal system, the prosecutors hold all the cards. If they want to play by the rules and let defendants have a fair trial, they can, but it’s up to them. If they want to look for mistakes in previous prosecutions, they can, but it’s up to them. The result is that the kind of justice a community gets depends, in most places, on who gets elected. And, in most places, district attorneys win elections by talking about how tough on crime they are; even supposedly liberal San Francisco just recalled its progressive prosecutor because of a virtually nonexistent crime wave. In this case, Syed (eventually) just got lucky.What can we do about this problem? Short of fundamentally rethinking the criminal legal system, the single measure that could have helped in Syed’s case is a compulsory open-file discovery statute: a law requiring prosecutors to turn over their complete investigative files to the defense. That is the only reliable way to protect against Brady violations — and, in addition, to balance the tremendous informational advantage held by the prosecution in any criminal case. In 1996, North Carolina passed a law granting open file access to people who had already been convicted and sentenced to death; ten convictions were reversed because of that law, which only applied to people on death row. In 2004, North Carolina expanded open file access to all felony cases.In criminal cases, access to prosecution files matters. If you’re not convinced by Syed’s case, remember the case of Timothy Foster — a man who would probably have been executed by now if the prosecutors had gotten around to shredding his file. We shouldn’t have to depend on the good faith of the prosecution.'], ['How Self-Help Is Not Helping', 'indi.ca', 'Oct 18', 'https://indica.medium.com/how-self-help-is-part-of-the-problem-6e88e8775bf1?source=home---------134------------------0----------', 'S\\nelf-help implies that you are the problem.

Is this a realistic expectation? How can an organization achieve this? So for our next few posts, we’ll deep dive into how to make this lofty aspiration practical.As with anything else in life — whether people, languages or customs — there is no shortcut to gaining familiarity; the only way is through direct and frequent exposure.With data, most teams inherently understand this — that is why dashboards are built and links are passed around and we are all reminded to “please bookmark it and check it often.”Unfortunately, unless your job title includes the word data, the practice of loading said bookmark does not frequently arise to the top of your to-do list, even if you really truly do think data is important! Thus begins the great death spiral of dashboards — because they go unused, they become unmaintained. Because they are unmaintained, when you finally have a need to look at them, they’re broken and useless.This is why data-informed teams rely on practices other than sheer will to create data familiarity. The big three are 1. weekly metrics reviews, 2. weekly insight reports, and 3. insights reviews.In this installment, we’ll tackle one of the single most impactful practices of building a data-informed team: the weekly metrics review.A weekly metrics review is a synchronous team meeting to review the key metrics for a scaling, post-PMF product with all functional team members present — ie, PM, engineering, design, operations. This type of review can (and should!) happen at the executive level, with the CEO and C-level executives, and recurse down to individual product teams.A weekly metrics review should be short and sweet (think 5–15 minutes, typically at the start of a regular team meeting) and led by the data person who walks the group through the key metrics for your collective area of work (e.g. new user growth, revenue, conversion rates, tickets resolved).The group should examine how key metrics have progressed over the past few weeks, ideally by looking at a series of time-series line charts. The presenter can also prepare a few key segments to review, for example if a certain type of user, platform, or market is strategically important to the team, or if the team has launched something that impacts a particular segment (like a new feature in a test market).It’s best to keep the meeting lightweight. Preparation should be easy, ideally no more than 30 minutes. Many great metrics reviews simply start with screenshots of dashboards. The data person shouldn’t have to have all the answers at their finger tips (why did active users spike two weeks ago?). It’s fine to circle back with an answer later.Metrics reviews are unlike product reviews or decision meetings; the point is a shared understanding of how the team is progressing towards its goals, not making decisions or creating action items.This is an unusual proposition, especially when ambitious team are (rightfully!) wary of wasting time in meetings. After reading an article like this and trying out this style of meeting, you may find yourself wondering: Is this meeting actually helping us accomplish anything? It’s common for the weekly metrics review to get cancelled, demoted to an e-mail update, or become the spawning ground for long lists of follow-up questions just so the group feels they did something.And yet, we argue that familiarity with the impact of the team’s work is in of itself an important enough goal to create a synchronous cadence around. Because we work in a team environment, having shared context across different functions is critical. The ideal outcome of a metrics review is that each person develops a shared understanding of the following questions:Few things focus a group as effectively as seeing a chart of week-over-week progress inching towards a goal target. The ritual of doing this together forces the room to confront questions like Are we likely to hit our goal? and Is our recent work having the impact we expected?, which ultimately ladder to the Holy Grail question: Is our strategy working?If it were obvious what a team should do, then success would be guaranteed. Alas, this is not how the world works.Creative teamwork is an infinite treadmill of trial and error — come up with ideas you hypothesize will lead to a desired outcome, then do the work to see if you’re right. When you take account of the results is when you learn to hone your skills.Take an example: let’s say we spent three months shipping Feature X. We might then have a decision to make, should we work on Xv2 next? Simply looking at X’s results in isolation isn’t enough to answer this question; we must consider this relative to other possibilities — what about improving features A, B or C? When we take the time to regularly reflect on the impact of our work through metric reviews, we build towards a richer knowledge of what really drives our business.Put another way, a major benefit of implementing weekly metrics reviews is that everyone on the team will improve their product thinking. For example, a designer will be less likely to propose an important button on the bottom of the page if he knows there’s roughly a 2x decrease in CTR compared to the top. An engineer will be more vigilant about holding the line on performance as she implements a new feature if she’s aware that snappy loading is a huge driver of usage.Every business has some level of volatility and seasonality. For example, enterprise apps are more used during weekdays, while video games are played more on weekends. Say you expect Januarys to be worse than Decembers for your business, and as predicted, you see a January dip. How big would the dip have to be for you to be worried that something is wrong?Familiarity with the normal rhythms of your business is essential to quickly identifying when you might need to take action because something is amiss, or when there’s likely to be an error in your measurement. For example, if a team member reports that a recent experiment led to a 20% increase in Key Metric X, but you know X to be extremely difficult to move, you would be suspicious and probe further. Over time, a well-honed understanding of what is normal leads to better forecasting and future planning.Done well, the practice of weekly metric reviews creates a shared understanding of progress, hones a team’s strategic chops, and enables faster detection of issues.But beware one of the secret killers of metric reviews — too many follow-up questions.To be clear, asking questions is an important part of building familiarity, and good questions can lead to important new discoveries. However, not all questions are worth the effort it takes to answer them. It’s easy to rattle off a dozen questions just because you can and you’re a curious person, but you may unwittingly be creating hours of work in chasing follow-ups. Instead, aim to ask questions that are likely to lead to a change in decision.A good litmus test for whether a data question is worth asking is this: What is my estimate for the most optimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? Conversely, What is my estimate for the most pessimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? If your actions for both questions are the same, you have a question that’s probably not worth answering.As an example, consider the question: What is our worst-performing country, and how much worse is it doing compared to an average country?If your pessimistic answer is Honestly I’m not going to do anything with this information unless it’s one of our Top 10 countries, then having someone spend a bunch of time querying for the result may not be worth it. (A better question might be: Which Top 10 country is performing the worst this quarter?)Practically speaking, starting the habit of metric reviews isn’t always easy, bacause you need convince other functions that it’s worth their time. If you are the data representative, start by discussing the idea with the person who has overall accountability for the team’s work and would be most interested in tracking progress and aligning towards a common goal. This could be the CEO, a general manager (ie head of operations, head of sales), or a product leader (ie PM, engineering lead, etc.)If you yourself are the directly accountable individual, then propose the idea of a metrics review with your data partner. If both of you agree, then ask the rest of the team to commit to trying it for at least a quarter. Tacking the practice to the start of a pre-existing team meeting also reduces friction.Your metrics review doesn’t have to be fully comprehensive to start. Consider beginning with a 10-minute slot every other week. The data representative should be prepared to direct the agenda and remind everyone of the goals in the early sessions (This is our main goal metric… I am showing you this segment because… I am showing you this related metric because…) Use the first few sessions to get feedback about the right set of metrics and cuts to look at. Remember: it’s better to start small and add over time than to overwhelm the group by flipping through dozens of charts and numbers. You can always follow up with a short e-mail summarizing what got discussed, with links for further exploration.Stay tuned for the sequel: why your team should have insights report and insights reviews.Past posts in this series:Manifesto for the Data-Informed\\nThe Blind Men, the Elephant, and the 3 Data MistakesWe want to hear your war stories and advice at datainformed@sundial.so.This article was written by Stanley Watt and Julie Zhuo.'], ['Out by October: the six weeks of Truss', 'Dan Perry', 'Oct 21', 'https://dan-perry.medium.com/out-by-october-the-six-weeks-of-truss-ceaf58b9e518?source=home---------119------------------0----------', 'British jokesters this week circulated a meme of Liz Truss next to an iceberg lettuce, asking which will last longer. The answer, it turns out, was the lettuce. While that did not come as a total surprise — I myself predicted volatility the week she assumed the UK’s prime ministership — the swiftness was breathtaking nonetheless.Resigning after six weeks in office, Truss thus becomes the briefest-serving prime minister ever, and the 38-day tenure of ex-finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng was second only to an even less fortunate “chancellor of the exchequer” who died. The two brought markets to a boil and the British pound to all-time lows with their misbegotten “mini-budget,” whose unfunded tax cuts for the rich and other hare-brained schemes have now been thoroughly reversed by Kwarteng’s successor Jeremy Hunt, operating as a sort of adult in the room and disapproving scold.The Conservative Party is now scrambling to elect a new prime minister within the next week. Whoever is chosen will be the fifth Tory prime minister since Labour’s Gordon Brown was finally defenestrated in 2010, following David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Truss herself (unless Johnson himself reapplies for the job from which he resigned amid scandal just three months ago, as is rumored).Incredibly, Cameron is the only one among them to have initially taken up residence at Number 10 Downing Street as a result of an actual vote by the British public — and even that only occurred with the help of the left-leaning Liberal Democrats, who for some reason agreed to provide him a majority in the otherwise “hung parliament.”In honor of the august occasion, I offer a few thoughts on the situation.ECONOMY WITH THE TRUTHLike their friends the US Republicans, the Tories talk a blue streak about competence with the economy but have little to show for it except for the prosperous pleased. Factoring out the COVID years, as that was force majeure, the Tories’ average annual growth since 2010 was around 1.8%; similarly factoring out the Great Recession, Labour’s average since 1997 had been 2.87%. London felt like a boomtown in those years, when indeed I lived there. Unless it was my departure that brought everything tumbling down, the blame sits with the Tories.There is a very simple reason for this: put a pound in the pocket of a pauper, and you will have spending which creates jobs, production and growth; put it in the pocket of a prince, and you will have another pound in his pocket.Adding insult to injury, national debt under these supposed fiscal conservatives has skyrocketed from under 40% of GDP for most of the Labour years to around 80%. It is incompetence of a genuinely interesting sort.THE BREXIT BLUNDERThe Tories are currently trying to sell the narrative that Labour will bring chaos. But other than fury at Tony Blair’s joining the Iraq war on false grounds, his time felt positively placid compared to the harsh austerity, Covid mismanagement, Scottish secession fears and Brexit fiasco of the Conservative period. And the absurd thing is that while the Tories caused Brexit, they didn’t even mean to: Cameron called the 2016 referendum to appease extremists in his party, only to discover that the idea — combined with a brilliant campaign brimming with lies — mustered a 52% majority.With a fabulosity worthy of Lewis Carroll, the Leave campaign argued that exiting the European Union would be simple and remunerative, and that hundreds of millions would be saved and rerouted to the National Health Service. They forgot that this would require a customs border to bisect Ireland (since the “Republic of” is in the EU) and that Britain’s main business is business, mainly with the EU. In a rare comical turn by racists, such Britons forgot (or never knew) that the immigrants they most disdain came from the Commonwealth, the club of former colonies, and not the EU.After an excruciating negotiation, Britain finally left the EU in 2020 and promptly lost at least 5% of its GDP; exports of services fell £100 billion below the pre-Brexit expectations, and farmers and workers are reeling. And the NHS? Despite the spending, the National Health Service is falling apart, and ambulance waits now reach the many hours. The Tories argue that this is because people are overusing the NHS, and American conservatives will say that socialized medicine can never work anyway. But it worked quite well until recently; Brits who would abolish the NHS are outnumbered by fans of the Philadelphia Eagles in Newcastle upon Tyne.Truss was typical of the Tories who opposed Brexit, then embraced it in a fake display of respect for the people. She thought that scowling and cutting taxes would make her into a Margaret Thatcher. She and the Conservatives are learning that folly comes with a price — or at least they would, if introspection were their mode. Judging by the polls, the public is already there.THE CORBYN FACTORBrexit might have been averted if not for Jeremy Corbyn, the far-left Labour leader who refused to genuinely back the Remain campaign on account of viewing the EU as a capitalist construct to be eschewed in favor of Hugo Chavez and Hassan Nasrallah. Tories still dine out on the grumpy anti-Semitism he personified and allowed to run riot in the party, which helped Boris Johnson win handily in 2019.But it probably won’t work, because few people on earth cut so vastly different a figure from the bedraggled and dishevelled Corbyn than Sir Keir Starmer; the current Labour leader looks mostly like a Tory, and also somewhat like a well-coiffed refrigerator. Corbyn was the gift that kept on giving for the Tories. Under Starmer Labour is now polling more than 30 points ahead of them.Britain’s first-past-the-post pure district electoral system should inflate Labour’s electoral majority to a parliamentary supermajority. They will say not a word about Brexit until Sir Keir in installed at number 10, because with this sort of lead one does not rock the boat. But after that, I’m willing to bet, the phrase “second referendum” will be given second life.A GREEN AND PLEASANT LANDIt’s easy to mock the Conservatives at such a time (well, at any time), but it would be unsporting to deny that they are adorable for repeatedly tossing out the tossers just because of incompetence. In resigning in July, Johnson declared that “when the herd moves, it moves.” Now the herd has moved again. Truss resigned because she had lost credibility, and this was seen as a crisis of legitimacy, and that was seen as a thing that matters.Sir Keir is now calling for a general election. One does not need to be held before 2024 — but don’t be surprised is the Conservatives go ahead and call an election anyway, almost guaranteeing their own demise. After 12 years, it’s time. But can anyone imagine the Republican Party (or basically any party) doing anything of the sort?Much may have changed in Britain, but the country remains oddly committed to probity and propriety.

A tall order to ask of a measly mushroom.I used a different guide this time. Actually, it was two people, a couple, both musicians. Before they came, they asked me to write down my intentions. I wrote: I want to learn how to detach from all that I love about life and to release any fear I have of death. The couple brought with them golden bowls, drums, tuning forks, and a giant gong whose sound from a single beat could transport a person into the stratosphere. They transformed my bedroom with purple drapes and votives. Before we began, they showed me the mushrooms they would make into a tea which Paul would inject into my feeding tube. They were beautiful: gnarled bluish stems like the trunks of eucalyptus trees, their caps undergirded with a yellowish filigree. Some people have asked me: Why use a guide at all? I don’t have a definitive answer to this because I have not taken psychedelics without a guide, but I think guides play an important role in creating an atmosphere, particularly with music, which helps in maintaining a focus on the traveler’s intention. The experience was exactly what I wanted it to be.When the mushrooms took hold, I imagined shedding my body, wriggling out of it like a worm offloading a thick skin, then hovering above as I watched myself being carried away. I sailed into outer space, saw a face that morphed from person to person. When asked if I wanted a second dose I first said no, but then I thought Why not, this certainly isn’t an experience I will ever have again. As I flew off once more, I understood I needed to loosen my control on things, including the specific time I would choose to terminate my life. As we were winding down, the couple sang a beautiful song they’d written about death. I don’t know if I have released all my hold on life, but I am definitely closer than I was before, and I feel an overall calm about facing what lies ahead of me. As the writer Annie Lamott would say, I will be taking it bird by bird.I intended last week to write about the push/pull of my life, the challenge of balancing the many reasons to go with the many reasons to stay. To be or not to be. But I have passed through a portal recently so I’m now in a place in which the pull of staying alive has weakened. Everything I do is difficult to pull off. I need help with the most minor of tasks. My left hand is useless, so I type now with one hand. [A sidebar. There are over 30 muscles in the human hand. They work in concert with the muscles of the wrist and forearm. Every one of those muscles makes a difference. I have learned this as I’ve watched them go. I urge you all to appreciate the complexity and skill of your hands!] I have always been a world class sleeper, but these days even sleep does not provide escape because it’s hard to breathe, and turn over, and my bones, unpadded now from weight loss, hurt. I don’t mean to complain; I am simply describing the reality. People, even those closest to me, have begun to speak to me differently as they pull my arms into sleeves or assist me in the bathroom, and I fully understand that. How do you speak to someone who cannot respond or accomplish the daily tasks of keeping herself alive? I want the release of death, and each morning and night as Paul and I look into each other’s eyes it is with acknowledgment that the end is near.But we have run into a roadblock of my own making — the “good girl” problem; the problem associated with a lifetime of too much striving. Because I have been performative at my doctors’ visits, mustering as much energy as I can, wanting to be a “good patient,” they still see me as a strong and determined warrior with vigor to last me more than six months. To invoke Death with Dignity, two doctors must sign a form saying you have only six months to live. Now it is my task to show my doctors the underlying truth: I know my body well, and I know it’s giving up. I’m going downhill fast. The thought of having to live for six months or more is unfathomable to me — it would feel like a dreadful sentence.Yesterday I realized what I had to do. I had to assert myself clearly. I wrote to my doctor, the one who diagnosed me, and who I adore, and who I perform for, and who is always telling me I am strong and have lots of time ahead of me, and I outlined my current condition, telling him how my quality of life has declined dramatically of late and asking him if he would sign off on Death with Dignity. He replied immediately. Sure, he said, I will do anything for you. He gave me permission to die.One of the reasons I know it’s time to quit is because I have no desire to write more fiction. For my entire life my brain — my whole body — has been in love with words and playing with ideas that might be expressed with words to become poems, or plays, or stories. But now I feel that impulse quieting down. An underdiscussed aspect of writing is that it takes an enormous amount of energy. If your physical body is not in good shape — well-fed, well-rested, exercised — your focus will probably be somewhat fuzzy, and it will be hard to produce good work. When I have printed out — or more accurately, when Paul has printed out — this draft of my new novel, I will be done. I have no doubt I would have written many more novels if I’d had the extra twenty years I expected to have, but that is not to be, and it’s fine. I will now not have to worry about becoming repetitive.It is now the day before Thanksgiving. My family members — sisters and their children and all their partners, as well as the adored baby — arrived last night and will stay for five or six days. I expect it to be a rollicking good time. Cooking and singing and building fires and admiring baby Radley. One of my nieces has put together an Emmons Family Playlist full of songs we have sung over the years. Many new memories we will be created over the next week.I have no idea what to say in conclusion. Perhaps just: Stay tuned and HAPPY THANKSGIVING!Cai'], ['Why “Microhistories” Rock', 'Clive Thompson', 'Sep 26', 'https://clivethompson.medium.com/why-microhistories-rock-c022cb207361?source=home---------220------------------0----------', 'I am a sucker for “microhistories”.In the world of publishing, the “microhistory” is a term of art for a particular type of book.

From infrastructure to housing, urban transformation is often influenced by the location of specific businesses. Coffee shops in New York City are no exception.Using data from dozens of different sources and techniques from a wide range of technologies and disciplines including game theory, machine learning, natural language processing, statistics, and urbanism, we formulated a model that predicts optimal coffee shop locations in New York City. Our findings reveal that the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn all show more economic promise than Manhattan, and resonate with recent population and job growth outside of Manhattan. In this article, we describe the iterative development of our predictive models and reveal specific forecasts of what the future of coffee in New York City might look like.New York City revolves around coffee. Considering there are 3,389 coffee shops in NYC, it is no wonder the city never sleeps. Dating back to the mid-1600s, while other colonies preferred drinking tea, New Yorkers were primarily drinking coffee. In the early-1800s, New York was one of the largest coffee roasting centers in the United States. More recently, mobile startup MassiveHealth found that New Yorkers drink 6.7 times the amount of coffee consumed by the average denizen of any other US city. If you’re a New Yorker, you’re probably drinking a cup right now.Coffee has been so central to New York City that one of its serving vessels — the classic ‘Anthora’ cup designed by Leslie Buck in 1963 — has become an icon of the city. Despite this enshrined position, coffee culture in NYC is anything but static; while it is still possible to buy coffee in an Anthora from a street cart or bodega, it is by no means the dominant paradigm. Like elsewhere in the US, New York’s coffee scene has ridden various “coffee waves”. Today’s NYC coffee landscape is hugely varied. And while we don’t take a stand on contentious topics like the emergence of the 4th wave, taking into account the diversity of the NYC coffee scene is core to our modeling efforts.The map below displays all 3,389 coffee shops in NYC (excluding restaurants, supermarkets, and other stores that might also sell coffee). Each point on the map represents a location-based business decision, and it is immediately clear that some areas in NYC are more popular than others (with Midtown and Lower Manhattan leading the way).To understand why coffee shops establish themselves where they do, we wondered: What makes one neighborhood more appealing than another? Why do coffee shops tend to cluster in the same areas? Are existing coffee shop locations optimal for business?To answer these questions, we constructed a model that simulates the coffee shop landscape in NYC. Using ideas from Game Theory as a foundation, our process can be divided into:As consumers, deciding where to buy coffee is relatively easy. For the most part, our decisions come down to a trade off between preference, affordability, and convenience: how far will you travel and how much will you pay to get coffee from your favorite coffee shop?As coffee shop owners, deciding where to locate is more complex. Should you set up shop near Bryant Park (Manhattan) despite an oversaturated competitive landscape? Should you locate in a less competitive area like Tottenville (Staten Island) despite lower customer density? Should high-end coffee shops go to Gramercy (Manhattan) since apartment rents are higher than other parts of the city?In order to postulate a general set of factors for predicting coffee shop locations, we started with the well-known “Hotelling Location Model” (1929) and its Principle of Minimum Differentiation. The Hotelling Model springs from the idea that vendors choose locations based on proximity to customers. Using this strategy, competitors tend to locate close to the same place — in the middle of all potential customers. This resonates with the map above: NYC coffee shops overwhelmingly cluster in Midtown and Lower Manhattan, the two densest parts of the city.While Hotelling’s theory is useful for understanding how distance to customers and competition affect business locations, there are limitations. Hotelling assumed that all vendors have identical offerings, a far cry from NYC coffee in 2017. Some revisions of Hotelling’s theory even claim that competitors with different offerings tend to pick locations as far away from each other as possible in order to create monopoly power. Thus, we will also be considering the factors that differentiate coffee shops — quality, price level, and coffee shop culture.Finally, since we’re modeling real world locations (with zoning restrictions and surrounding neighborhoods) we include available commercial locations, neighborhood culture, and neighborhood wealth in our models.We began developing our simulation with a basic set of equations that stuck close to Hotelling’s original distance-based formulation. For each equation, we have variable weights (Wu1, Wu2, etc) that we algorithmically tune, refining our models iteratively to produce more realistic results.Utility of coffee shop C. We define our utility function to be the tradeoff between the quality of coffee shop C and distance to coffee shop C:where the Quality of C is determined by aggregating user reviews of C from a variety of sources)Probability of a customer going to coffee chop C. We define the probability of a customer choosing coffee shop C to be the Utility of C divided by the Sum of the Utility of all other coffee shops in the area of C:Expected number of customers for coffee shop C in neighborhood N. We can estimate the number of customers a coffee shop C would have if it were to locate in a given neighborhood N by taking the sum, across all neighborhoods n of the product of the Probability of Choosing C in n times the population of n. Or more succinctly put:With these equations in hand, we ran through the 3,389 coffee shops in New York City and sequentially located each one in an optimal neighborhood by allowing coffee shops to relocate until reaching a near Nash equilibrium. This provided our first results.Our first simulated results had little to do with the current coffee shop mapping of NYC, though it did bear a striking resemblance to mappings of residential populations across the city. This failing makes sense in light of one of coffee’s core features: it is a daytime drink. Thus the first refinement we made to the model was to use the daytime (rather than residential) population of neighborhoods in our model.Incorporating daytime population into our model produced an intense concentration of coffee shops in lower and midtown Manhattan, and resulted in a map that came closer to reality. However certain areas (Fifth Avenue, Wall Street) were clearly oversaturated, with coffee shops occupying an impossible number of adjacent locations.We addressed this problem by incorporating one of the key inputs discussed above: coffee shops should only be allowed to locate in commercially zoned spaces.Incorporating commercial zoning into our model produced a map that again came closer to the current NYC coffee landscape. The oversaturation of Central Park South and Wall Street was ameliorated, and placement of coffee shops outside of Manhattan started to articulate main thoroughfares, capturing neighborhood life in the outer boroughs.While we were happy with the placements in aggregate, we hadn’t yet taken into account perhaps the single most important economic factor: price.We incorporated price into our model by revising our Utility function, setting:Adding price as an input to the model necessitated a refinement of our success metric — rather than number of customers, total revenue now defined success.We then allowed coffee shops to set their own price, resulting in a trade off: As coffee shops set their price higher, they make more money per customer, but risk having fewer customers.Furthermore, to account for the wide variations in NYC pricing (of meals, rentals, houses, etc) we included a composite Neighborhood Economy Index as an input; therefore the pricier a neighborhood is in general, the less the price of coffee matters in our model.While the overall location selection closely resembled reality (as it did in our previous model), the geographic price distribution was far off. In particular, simulated coffee prices in Manhattan were significantly lower than they should be, due to the following set of implications:High density of coffee shops in Manhattan → High level of competition in Manhattan → Lower prices in ManhattanAs it turned out, this failure was instructive, resonating with a truth familiar to anyone who has bought a pour-over coffee in the East Village in 2017 — In Manhattan, coffee shops do not compete on price, they compete on culture.La Colombe and Dunkin’ Donuts do not compete solely on price because they present radically divergent cultures (and products) to consumers. Individual coffee shops target different segments of the population — A third wave coffee shop might do well in Bushwick, but will likely avoid Times Square. Dunkin’ Donuts may find more success in Times Square and want to stay away from the L train, where it has been less than welcomed.To account for these differences, we divided coffee into three (sure to be contentious) groupings: Mainstream (Blue in maps; Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, 7-Eleven…), Third Wave (Pink in maps; Stumptown, La Colombe, Blue Bottle…) and Local (Green in maps; NYC only).Leveraging Topos’s suite of features and indices (which capture a ‘Psychographic’ portrait of every neighborhood) we were able to compute the cultural fit of each coffee shop C for every NYC neighborhood N. We then further revised our Utility function to take into account cultural fit:As with other simulations, we allowed each coffee shop to relocate until reaching a near Nash equilibrium across all factors. This equilibrium condition ensured that neighborhoods don’t become oversaturated with a particular category of coffee shop, even if that category is the optimal cultural fit.As can be seen above, the simulated results came close to the reality of coffee culture in NYC in 2017. Midtown is filled with Mainstream coffee shops. Third Wave coffee shops cluster in Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and eastern Queens, but rarely in the Bronx and never in Staten Island. Local coffee shops are not confined to any one area since they all tend to be different. While we undoubtedly could have continued to refine our model to account for ever more detail (Pour over? Kyoto-style cold brew towers? Next-gen coffee sodas?) at this point we felt the model had achieved a level of reality where we were curious what predictions it would make about the future of coffee in NYC.Maintaining the existing ratio of Mainstream : Local : Third Wave coffee shops, we used our model to simulate the optimal location of the next 200 coffee shops to open in NYC.At a high level, the most surprising insight was the low number of predicted coffee shops in Manhattan.In contrast, the Bronx presented a wealth of opportunities, claiming the largest share (31%) of the 200 simulated points. This resonates with the Bronx’s recent surge in population and jobs in the private sector.For more cultural specificity, we decided to plot the next 10 predicted locations for a few coffee categories and franchises.With the exception of Battery Park, Dunkin’ Donuts finds more success moving far from Manhattan, with only a single Manhattan location vs 4 in the Bronx and 4 in Queens.Bronx: 4; Queens:4; Manhattan: 1; Brooklyn: 1In contrast to Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks finds significant opportunity in Manhattan, where its higher prices are less of a factor. Nonetheless, over half of Starbucks projected locations are in the outer boroughs.Manhattan: 5; Queens: 3; Bronx: 1; Brooklyn: 1While Manhattan and Brooklyn still present the most opportunity for third wave coffee shops (as might be expected), it is interesting to note some specific location trends within each borough: upwards in Manhattan, and outwards in Brooklyn. Rather than solely clustering in Lower Manhattan and commuter Brooklyn, we find Manhattan locations moving up towards Harlem and Brooklyn locations moving away from commuter neighborhoods, making it as far as Ridgewood in Queens (which, to be fair, may be the most Brooklyn of Queens neighborhoods)Manhattan: 5; Brooklyn: 4; Queens: 1Coffee shops are undoubtedly a small piece of the much larger puzzle that is contemporary urban living; yet their importance should not be underestimated. From their influence on the enlightenment to their ever-evolving status as a “third place”, coffee shops — and the culture they participate in, create, and project — have played a vital, often controversial role in shaping urban experience. Thus understanding coffee shops in a variety of ways — from analyzing the language used to discuss particular franchises with NLP to simulating future coffee landscapes — constitutes a small but vital aspect of the way we, at Topos, are changing the understanding of cities through the twin lenses of big data and artificial intelligence.This post is part of an ongoing series capturing different insights we generate while developing our platform.

Abandoning my homework, I hopped off my chair and sped around the hallway into the kitchen. My uncle, glimmering in sweat, waved at me and said in Cantonese: mo see mo see (冇事,冇事) — It’s nothing! It’s nothing!Apparently the cover of the wok had tipped over the counter and was doing a windmill on the kitchen floor. As if entranced by the spinning, everyone in the kitchen watched until it performed its final spin and flopped on the floor from exhaustion. My uncle picked it up and motioned that the show was over.My aunt returned to scooping white rice into take-out boxes. My other uncle continued to hose down pots and kitchenware, splattering water onto the floor. I skipped back to the front of the restaurant and climbed onto the seat. Next to me was a stack of menus waiting for me to fold after I finished my homework.In 1988, my parents joined the class of Chinese immigrants who opened a family restaurant in this land of opportunity. Despite not having extensive education, many first-generation immigrants, like my parents, were able to open a restaurant as a way to provide gainful employment for themselves and make a living for their families.A few months before, my father asked me and my brother if we could think of a good name for a Chinese restaurant. We said — how about Today’s? My father took out a napkin and asked us to spell it for him.Later that evening, my brother and I sprawled out on the linoleum floor of our tenement with a set of markers and wrote on a large piece of paper: Today’s Chinese Restaurant.Our customized sign would become a banner used on our grand opening day.Located on 218 5th avenue in Brooklyn, in an area that is now populated by young and hip professionals in Park Slope, the restaurant became an extended family space from our tight quarters of Manhattan’s Lower East Side.I was always excited to go to the restaurant after school and on the weekends. Breaking away from the humdrum of home, the restaurant was the site of where I evaded doing homework, where I watched cartoons on a handheld television, and where I fell in love —with my first sip of Mountain Dew.Sitting alongside my mom, aunties, and cousins, I helped package fried noodle chips, unstring buckets of snow peas, and folded stacks of menus and flyers. I casually weaved in and out of the kitchen to help myself to a soda or to the hot and sour soup that simmered on the stove in an industrialized pot. With abundant food and activity all around, I was free of worldly concerns.One day, while laggardly lounging at the tables in the front of the restaurant, I watched my uncle deal with a particularly irate customer complaining about his order. As if becoming the boiling frog that did not suspect danger, I let the steam of my hot and sour soup gingerly melt my face while the temperature rose around me. As the voices became more belligerent, my dad motioned my uncle to take me to the back in the kitchen. I frantically scooped up my soup bowl and for the first time, it occurred to me that this place of refuge was also a place that brought immense anxiety for the adults.My young age at the time shielded me from the more grueling aspects of the business. My high school aged cousins, who had just arrived in the United States a few months after the restaurant opened, were swiftly put to work.After school and on weekends, they delivered take-out orders in the neighborhood and walked door to door to stuff restaurant flyers in the mailboxes of each house in the neighborhood. Eventually, they would approach the daunting apartment complexes in the area to continue to spread the good word on the restaurant. To be efficient, each cousin claimed a building on either side of the street. With their hearts racing from unseen, but real danger at the time, each person would enter the dimly lit buildings and place flyers into each apartment mailbox. The imposing heavy front door of the buildings that muted the loud city streets would have also muted any cries for help.Like the lore of the big bad wolf, I heard stories of my cousins being mugged on their delivery routes. As if being initiated into a sorority, one cousin was sent to deliver an order to a customer who was known to give good tips in a large building complex. When she returned from the drop-off, everyone waited outside the restaurant in silent relief to celebrate her safe return. In her pocket was $5 extra that made the delivery all worthwhile.Today’s Chinese Restaurant not only represented a means for economic opportunity, but also a means to deepen kinship for the family. We ate meals together and sometimes closed the restaurant early to hold family birthday parties. With a kitchen within reach, my uncles did not hesitate to bring out their best dishes to make sure everyone’s bellies were happy and full. (Once, however, we did order pizza.)The restaurant was also a site for political activity, where we hosted demonstrations against the Chinese government during pro-democracy protests that culminated in the Tiananmen Square Massacre on June 4,1989. During this period, we set up a table outside the restaurant that provided people with information on the current events that appear so disconnected from everyday life in Brooklyn.One woman came over to ask one of my uncles what the protest was about. Getting lost in his English, I rushed over to my uncle’s aid.I explained to her, in my best understanding as a second grader, how the Chinese government was squelching protests by students who are calling for freedom. These were students, like me, who only wanted to be free to live the consequences of our own choices, and not decisions made by government decree. Although at the time, I personally did not fully comprehend the democratic principles I was espousing, I had the sense that, here in America, my family led privileged lives.She thanked me, wished us luck on raising awareness, and complimented me on my English. Before she went on her way, I handed her a restaurant menu and asked her to come try our food, especially the hot and sour soup.Just as quickly as the restaurant had entered our lives, our frenzied restaurant days ended two years later without much fanfare. But the bright red awning and bamboo-colored seats have been forever seared into my memory.Over the past three decades, the restaurant’s location has transferred hands from business to business. Currently in its place is a pet store — each turnover represents a business that has supported the livelihood of a family and fed the opportunities of their children.I look forward to bringing my son on a sojourn to this stomping ground of my childhood. Perhaps, standing there with his grandparents, we can reconnect to the long lasting values of hard work and perseverance that have laid the foundation of economic mobility for this family.And perhaps, standing with his grandparents, my son can feel the sense of freedom that my parents felt when they came to this country — that their futures, especially that of their children’s, are not limited by the circumstances to which they are born, but infinitely tied to the initiatives they are willing to take. And by maintaining and creating bonds with family and community, his life’s journey will be made boundlessly more meaningful, as it has for me.'], ['He’s My Daddy and I’ll Talk About Him if I Wanna', 'Bernie’s Daughter', 'Feb 3', 'https://medium.com/@berniesdaughter/hes-my-daddy-and-i-ll-talk-about-him-if-i-wanna-db155d149ff3?source=home---------20------------------0----------', 'I pissed off the internet for daring to talk about my dad.This year will mark 14 years since my dad died.

For perspective, 2021 iPhone revenue was $192B, more than half of Apple’s total revenue of $366B, this from almost nothing ($123M) in 2007. And this doesn’t count App Store revenue, mostly for iPhone apps. The numbers aren’t directly disclosed but reliable sources estimate tens of billions of dollars in net revenue, the riches Apple gets to keep after paying developers.We’ve looked at three fields of opportunity: The unacknowledged Apple Car (the “Titan” project), Augmented Reality (AR) devices, and forays into the healthcare market, none of which is a feasible candidate. The car project looks unrealistically adventurous; AR devices, while more likely, probably wouldn’t enjoy the everywhere-all-the-time use that is the mark of smartphones; and, while the healthcare field is huge and open to more effective ways to spend our money, doing-well-while-doing-good devices, such as hearing aids, don’t offer iPhone-like potential. I hope I’m wrong on one or more of these opportunities, but I just don’t see a huge new Apple hardware growth wave in our future.I was thinking about all of this while watching Tim Cook and his team of presenters introduce new Apple Watches, AirPod Pros, and improved iPhones during Apple’s latest unveiling event. “New iPhones! New Apple Watches! New AirPods!”, exclaims Greg Kumparak of TechCrunch. I assume Mr. Kumparak’s breathlessness is somewhat facetious. There was an interesting Satellite Communication feature, currently for emergency use only, but otherwise I had a hard time summoning his level of excitement.Certainly, Apple continues to move its products forward, but with little hope for another breakthrough of iPhone proportions. One can’t call Apple hopeless — too many critics have had to eat their “Apple is Doomed” proclamations — but without a Next Big Thing in its future, Apple could be viewed as living in incremental mode. Perhaps it has reached a stage where it will survive — and no doubt thrive — by simply improving existing devices, relying on its tentacular array of services to bring in new customers and fortify the loyalty of its faithful.This led me to reconsider my interpretation of Apple’s business model and the way the company thinks of itself.In a 2021 MN, I criticized Apple management for making vague identity statements. I thought that the “Enriching Lives” credo, while mellifluent, could mean anything and thus fails to be a cynosure, a North Star for company employees.I suggested a simpler, sharper statement: Apple makes personal computers, small, medium, and large. Everything else Apple does has but one raison d’être: They push up the volumes and margins of the company’s main hardware products. For example, App Stores exist to make Watches and iPhones and Mac Pros more useful, more pleasant, thus improving revenue and profit. (I also looked at Microsoft’s statement of purpose, “Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more,” and offered a sharper redefinition: “We create business software for individuals and organizations.”)It’s only a year later, but I’m already changing my tune. Instead of a model that casts personal computers as the star with everything else relegated to a supporting role, I see Apple’s money pump running on a virtuous circle of Devices and Services that work together to, ahem, enrich people’s lives.In this model, Apple’s most fruitful growth will come from an ever-expanding array of Services: banking, more sports streaming, and, yes, advertising, pegged at only $4B in 2021 but supposed to grow to $10B or more in the next couple of years, and more.(“Ads?” you may rightly ask, “What about the iAds failure? Apple’s walled garden is a non-starter for ads.” Yes, iAds was a failure, but that was more than a decade ago when Steve Jobs hoped to reach 50% of the mobile ad market. The company has changed since then. By promoting its privacy protection and anti-tracking features, Apple has made serious inroads into an advertising market that has been dominated by social networking sites, so much so that Zuckerberg and others complain that Apple is hurting their bottom line. If Apple continues to grow its ad business, accusation of hypocrisy will certainly follow. Food for a future Monday Note.)Apple has long recognized that Services has serious revenue potential. In the call that traditionally follows Apple’s quarterly earnings release, Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri have repeatedly emphasized that the Services business is both a stabilizer and a growth engine, reaching almost 20% of total revenue in the company’s most recent quarter (ending June 2022), with margins in the 60% range.My feeling is that Cook and his team are way ahead of us — or me, anyway. They’ve known for a while that Apple has entered a different era. With no Next Big Thing on the horizon — with Devices in a safe-but-slow incremental upward incline — the company has been compelled to move into conquest mode with its Services. This forced change in priorities has consequences, the compass needle points in a different direction. The reward system, people hired, career opportunities, “How We Do Things Here” culture…everything changes.As an example, the introduction of an “Apple Bank” or an “Apple Search Engine” could yield the company more glory — and profit — than would a new-and-improved iDevice running on the latest, fastest, coolest Apple Silicon chip. Yes, a better iPhone would be cool, but the market is cooling…It pains this aging geek to think such thoughts, but I can’t help but assume that Apple will evolve into a different sort of company. Nonetheless, I still want to see an Apple Car and see the company’s still working on that bet as a potential head against incrementalism.jlg@gassee.com or @gassee'], ['Strategy & Sunshine', 'Roger Martin', 'Oct 10', 'https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-sunshine-ec9371a3eb6c?source=home---------146------------------0----------', 'I have called many business initiatives to be doomed from inception and I have done so in advance or contemporaneously, not later when the results manifested themselves. I often get asked how I knew. So, I thought I would write about the answer as my 50th Year II Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece, Strategy & Sunshine: Beware of the Shadow. You can find the previous 102 PTW/PI here.Examples of the PhenomenonIn 2000, AOL and Time Warner merged in a $350 billion deal to join Internet access with media content. Massive enthusiasm greeted the deal. I said it would be a debacle. Sure enough, it now is considered the biggest corporate disaster of all time.In 2001, Pringles, the reconstituted stacked potato chip leader, entered the most profitable salted snack category, corn chips, with Torengos to battle Doritos, Frito Lay’s near monopoly brand. I was mortified when I heard about it and begged Pringles leadership to reverse course. But it was too late. Bagged chip leader, Frito-Lay, decided to enter the stacked chips category with Stax to show that if Pringles attacked the heart of Frito Lay’s business, it would attack the heart of the Pringles business. It was an expensive disaster for Pringles.In 2011, the ‘genius’ investor Bill Ackman installed Ron Johnson as the CEO of venerable retailer JC Penney (JCP), a company his hedge fund controlled. Johnson immediately announced a plan to revitalize JCP by transforming 10% of each store into his vision of the future — the New JCP. That would demonstrate that the whole JCP could be transformed into a successful version of its former self. I knew it would fail — and indeed it did. Overall same-store sales declined at approximately 25% in the first year of this experiment. That disaster was too much to overcome. Johnson was out 18 months after his appointment and the genius investor Ackman exited with a big loss.For decades, telecom services providers promoted switching by giving new customers a much better deal than existing customers. But they don’t do it anymore — because existing customers recognized that becoming ex-customers and taking up the competitors’ new customer offers made compelling sense. I tried to get clients to stop doing it — but lost that battle on more than one occasion.The Sunshine on Your Face & the Dark Shadow Behind YouNone of these things should have happened. After the fact, they look like obviously stupid ideas. But at the time, very smart people, with lots of very smart advisors made very big investments behind these ideas. What did they all miss and why did they miss it? There is a thread that connects them all, which I will explain with a metaphor.It is a pleasant and warm feeling to have a bright sun shining on your face — especially on a chilly or windy day. It is far superior to a cloudy day that blocks the warm rays of the sun. Our inclination is to focus intently on the sunshine on our face because it is so pleasant and welcome. In contrast, it is easy to forget that because the sun is shining brightly on your face, there will be a shadow behind you. The very force that creates the warmth on your face also creates the shadow behind you. No sunshine; no shadow. More sunshine; deeper, darker shadow.Let’s use JCP to illustrate. The sunshine on the face was the transformational investment in the 10% of each store that was the New JCP. Johnson was right. Sales per square foot in that space doubled in the first year. It is easy to focus on the warmth of that sunlight — a signal that the whole of JCP could be transformed into the New JCP.But the focus on the warmth of the sun distracted focus from the inexorably linked dark shadow. To get to that 10% of New JCP space, JCP customers had to wander through the 90% of ‘old JCP.’ While the customers that frequented JCP were used to the look and feel of the ‘old JCP,’ when they experienced the side-to-side comparison with the ‘New JCP’ space, ‘normal’ now looked a lot worse. That dark shadow was the direct result of the sunlight on the face of the New JCP space.Doubling its sales per square foot in 10% of the space combined with a 25% drop in overall same-store sales means that sales per square foot in the remaining 90% of the store dropped 40% — a dark, dark shadow that ended this transformational experiment that cost Ackman half of his investment, or about $500 million. That is the cost of forgetting to consider the dark shadow produced by the sunshine in which you are luxuriating.It plays out over and over again. Telecom services and insurance providers give extremely attractive deals to new customers. Their faces are awash in warm sunshine because it is an awesome way to acquire new customers. The sunshine, in fact, is so strong that it is impossible for the competitors, who are losing those customers to the new customer offers, not to notice. They have no choice but to offer their own new customer offers of similar if not greater attractiveness. And those are equally successful. The result is that each competitors sees existing customer churn rise dramatically, while exchanging existing customers for new customers at dramatically lower pricing. Again, the same force that created the warm sun also creates the unanticipated dark shadow — in this case a dark shadow that hurt much more than the sunlight helped.In the Pringles case, the bright sunshine was the ‘white space’ sales in a brand new category. The dark shadow that was inextricably linked to that sunshine was Frito-Lay’s reaction. It wasn’t any sort of counterattack in the business in question: corn chips. It was a counterattack in Pringles (until the Torengos launch) only business. Frito-Lay had smartly stayed in the bagged whole potato chips business and allowed Pringles to have a monopoly in the stacked reconstituted potato chip business. They didn’t invade each other’s businesses. Instead, they let consumers decide which of these two substitute products they favored. But when Pringles entered Frito-Lay’s (then) most profitable business, it had to send a signal that the gloves were coming off and the biggest, most powerful, and most successful salted snack company on the planet entered Pringles’ core business. Torengos was a dumb idea in the first place and only lasted five years before being pulled for the market. But Stax is still on the shelves today, reminding anyone still at Pringles that it is dangerous to let the sunshine on your face stop you from thinking about the shadow behind your back.The AOL/Time Warner merger was based on the dumb idea that having Time Warner content would enable AOL to beat up on its competitors (per the silly owner economics argument discussed last week). The sky for this idea was perpetually cloudy. But let’s imagine a sunshine scenario in which the combination would have given AOL a decisive advantage over its Internet access competitors. Time Warner’s content creation business is a highly-scale sensitive business. When it invests in a piece of content — a movie for example — it wants to get as broad distribution as possible to cover the fixed costs of creating it. At the time, AOL had a market share of approximately 15%, meaning 85% was in the hands of competitors. Had a world emerged in which content was critical to the success of Internet access providers, all of AOL’s competitors would have stopped buying Time Warner content and wrecked the economics of Time Warner’s business — the dark shadow. In this case, there was no sunshine so no dark shadow took shape — but the merger would have been doomed either way.Managing Shadows, or NotSometimes the shadow is manageable. Apple famously launched the iPhone in 2007 with a two-year exclusive distribution deal (later extended to five years) with AT&T, at the time one of the two dominant mobile services players in the US, by far the world’s most lucrative mobile market at the time. The sunshine on Apple’s face was blinding! However, the dark shadow was that it forced the co-leader (and since clear leader) Verizon to throw its weight behind the Android OS, which guaranteed that Android would succeed and in due course it became the dominant mobile OS in the world. Apple has been able to withstand the dark shadow and iPhone is still the most profitable mobile phone franchise in the world. But it would be interesting to ask whether Apple could have avoided creating that dark shadow and succeeded to even a greater extent?A dark shadow that has been more problematic is the one created by Microsoft’s PC OS — near-monopoly Windows. It has produced sunshine galore to be sure and Microsoft has milked it for every possible dollar, with little evident care about customers other than the dollar signs on their backs. I still view Windows 95 as the most recent Windows upgrade that about which users were enthused — and that was a quarter-century ago. That notwithstanding, Microsoft has managed to maintain a nearly 80% share of PC operating systems. But the sunshine produced a very dark shadow. Users have switched screens. If you go back to 2000, the only smart screen on which users worked was a computer screen, so Microsoft’s OS share equaled its share of hours utilizing a smart screen. Now your smart screen is likely to be a smartphone or a tablet and on both of those screens, Microsoft’s share is below 1%. And there is really robust competition among OS for those screens (iOS and Android) causing the user experience to accelerate rather than stagnate as with Windows. As a result, Microsoft’s share of hours using a smart screen has plummeted and will continue to fall for the foreseeable future. Windows is slowly but surely being eroded by the dark shadow.Another dark shadow has yet to be played out. As of today, no company in the world has more sunshine on its face than Tesla, as it has proven to the world that electric vehicles (EV) is a viable business — and it is the undisputed leader in the business. Until Tesla generated this massive, blinding sunshine on its face, the global auto OEMs invested minimally in EV. But now the dark shadow has taken shape as a result of the brilliant sunshine. Globally, auto OEMs are predicted to spend over half a trillion dollars on EV in the next 5–10 years. The world has never before seen such an investment in anything. Don’t get me wrong: Tesla is an awesome company. But I don’t believe that the dark shadow that it has caused with its success is factored into its current market value, even if that is 46% off its all-time high.Practitioner InsightsTo continue the metaphor, the core purpose of strategy is to produce sunshine on your face.Your strategy isn’t worth a lick, as with AOL/Time Warner, if all it produces is cloudy weather. There won’t be a dark shadow with no sun, but you have a bigger problem to worry about: the lack of a useful strategy.But if your strategy produces sunshine on your face, you have to consider the dark shadow thoroughly and proactively. The first job is to identify the darkest shadow. Assume your strategy will produce sunshine: what is the nature of the shadow it will produce? Who will take the problematic actions? If it is a competitor, as with the new customer discounts case? Or is it is a competitor of a customer, as with Apple/AT&T?Then think about how you can tweak your strategy to mitigate the competitive pain of the shadow. If you can’t, then assess whether the sunshine prize warrants incurring the shadow. If not, don’t wait for the shadow to overwhelm your strategy. Stop and fundamentally rethink it.'], ['Finding My Fighting Words: How I Learned to Have Uncomfortable Conversations', 'Daniel Shiner', 'May 4, 2020', 'https://humanparts.medium.com/finding-my-fighting-words-how-i-learned-to-have-uncomfortable-conversations-9c0bb09c50c?source=home---------45------------------0----------', 'I’\\nm sitting alone in a coffee shop in Manhattan and I’m about to become the most disliked person in the room. First, I’m going to interrupt the man reading quietly near the window and ask for a sip of his latte. Next, I’m going to ask the line of people waiting to pay if I can cut to the front of the queue. And before I do any of this, I am going to lie down on the dusty, coffee-stained floor — eyes open, slowly counting from one to 20 — as the rest of the room looks on in uncomfortable, visible disapproval. This is how I chose to spend my last vacation. Here’s why.Growing up, all I ever heard about was “EQ.” It was the mid-’90s, and psychologist Daniel Goleman had just popularized the concept of emotional intelligence with his 1995 bestseller of the same name. Now emotional quotient, or EQ, was becoming the latest buzzword to describe this new form of smarts. Unlike IQ, which tracked conventional measures of intelligence like reasoning and recall, EQ measured the ability to understand other people — to listen, to empathize, to self-regulate, and to appreciate. My mother, an elementary school principal, prized brains and hard work, but she placed a special emphasis on Goleman’s new idea. To her, EQ was what separated the good students from the great after they left the halls of her school. It was the elixir that transformed ideas and intellect into impact and influence. She was determined to send my sister and I into the adult world with as much of this elixir as possible, and she led regular dinner table conversations on the subjects of empathy, communication, and patience to do so.But when I finally began my first full-time job after graduation — an early employee at a fledgling tech startup — something was missing. Sure, EQ mattered: It was crucial in clinching the interview and integrating quickly into a small, tightly knit team. But before long, I began to notice a second elixir swirling around in the back pockets of some of my colleagues. It gave their opinions extra weight and their decisions added impact. It propelled them into positions of credibility and authority. Strangest of all, it seemed like the anti-EQ: Instead of knowing how to make others feel good, this elixir gave people the courage to do the opposite — that is, to say things that others did not want to hear.This was assertiveness. Psychologists conventionally define assertiveness as the healthy middle ground between passivity and aggressiveness, but in practice, I found that it boiled down to the mastery of a single skill: the ability to have uncomfortable conversations. Assertive people — those with high “AQ” — can comfortably engage in the sorts of conversations that make many of us squirm. They ask for things they want, decline things they don’t, provide constructive feedback, and engage in direct confrontation and debate. While the top performers at our company varied widely in terms of personality, gender, and introversion/extroversion, they all excelled at these types of tough talks.In fact, the more time I spent in the working world, the more I felt I could map everyone I interacted with according to their levels of EQ and AQ.Those with low EQ and low AQ were the “grumblers.” Difficult to work with and unable to speak up for themselves, grumblers turned to gossip and passive aggression to deal with others. Creating a toxic environment wherever they went, they generally encountered a low ceiling in their personal and professional lives.Those with high EQ but low AQ were the “people pleasers.” While well-liked and collaborative, people pleasers struggled with conflict and saying no to others. Like the grumblers, they also hit a ceiling, passed over by managers and steamrolled by friends and family for not having the guts to have tough conversations.Those with low EQ but high AQ were the “assholes.” Blissfully unaware of or uninterested in social graces, assholes ruthlessly told you what they thought without fear of or concern for how it made you feel. Assholes could sometimes buck the EQ trend and rise remarkably high on their AQ alone, but most eventually hit a ceiling, albeit a higher one. Peers whispered that they were hard to work with, and they were excluded from the best professional opportunities and personal relationships.Those with high EQ and high AQ were the “respected leaders.” These people were likable and great to work with, but also knew how to say no, ask hard questions, and share constructive feedback—and to do so in a way that was firm and respectful. This is where most of us want to be.Turning the mirror on myself, I landed in the top-right quadrant, but just barely. A lifetime honing my EQ helped me empathize with those around me, but it also left me overly sensitive to situations where I had to say or do things that might make others unhappy. While I didn’t avoid conflict, I was always frustrated by how much my mental machinery would degrade when I had to say or do something that could upset someone. Engaging in heated debates and providing negative feedback were the hardest for me. My thinking would get cloudy. I’d stumble through my words or use too many of them. After the conversation was over, I’d be frustrated by how poorly I had conveyed my message and feel emotionally drained from the experience. Compare that with the people I respected the most — our CEO, say, or my mother — who seemed to be able to maintain clarity of thought and speech in even the most uncomfortable situations.And there was another thing that kept me low on the AQ spectrum. Somewhere in my twenties, I’d lost track of my own introverted tendencies and let them snowball into moderate social anxiety, specifically when it came to approaching strangers. It felt like another unintended consequence of doubling down on EQ. Anytime I had to approach someone I didn’t know — at a trade show, networking event, or social occasion — my empathy would kick into a sort of broken, distorted overdrive. I’d instinctively imagine the person I wanted to speak to being annoyed or uncomfortable with my overture, feel a spike of anxiety at this imagined reaction, and more often than not, I’d bail. It felt like a dirty secret: I regularly spoke at conferences in front of hundreds of people, but I’d break into a sweat if I had to approach a single person in the crowd.This was a problem. Whether negotiating for a car or for venture capital, providing honest feedback to a romantic partner or a business partner, I knew that a stronger stomach for uncomfortable conversations would be necessary to get the things I wanted out of life. I became fixated on finding a way to move up the AQ spectrum.EQ is notoriously hard to improve. Socializing is a complex symphony of subtle cues and interactions, and getting better means learning to play an ensemble of new social instruments, often all at once. In contrast, improving my AQ felt like a much more manageable task. Instead of an orchestra, assertiveness felt like a single important, imposing instrument: the courage to tell people things they may not want to hear. This was good — I figured if I could just improve on this one skill, I could knock my AQ up a few notches.The problem was that meaningful improvement of any skill requires deliberate practice, the intensive form of practice coined by K. Anders Ericsson, the grandfather of expert performance psychology. Deliberately practicing a skill means setting a target just outside your comfort zone, crafting exercises that enable you to work repeatedly toward that target with intense concentration, and then, once you achieve it, raising the bar and repeating the process. A tennis player working on their backhand does not casually play games with friends, hoping to improve; they set a target, load the ball machine, and work the backhand — focusing intensely on every swing, observing the output, and adjusting their technique as they go.But there was no obvious ball machine for uncomfortable conversations. Providing friends or family with unsolicited “feedback” might be a fast way to practice, but I’d likely be left with no one to share my findings with once it was over. Waiting for real conversations to emerge organically was an option, but I reckoned that I only had about 10 really hard ones a year. Worse, most of these conversations snuck up on me, with no time to prepare beforehand or reflect meaningfully afterward. This left me with perhaps two or three opportunities a year to really focus and deliberately practice the skill. At that rate, by the time I got in the 40 or 50 reps I thought I’d need to make a meaningful improvement, some of the best years of my life would be over.This was when my gears started to turn. Could I build a ball machine for uncomfortable conversations? Could I create exercises — more realistic than role playing but safer than experimenting with real relationships — that simulated the key skills I wanted to develop? And could I wrap these exercises into a sort of personal bootcamp, which concentrated lots of practice into a short period of time, in order to accelerate my progress?I set out to create a bootcamp for uncomfortable conversations. Here’s how I did it:I created two types of exercises to develop my AQ: uncomfortable negotiations and unusual conversations.Uncomfortable negotiations involved entering into negotiations at flea markets, where I would offer vendors unreasonably low prices for their wares — generally 25% or less of the retail price. The negotiations would follow a specific script, where I had to make the offer and then remain silent, maintaining eye contact until they replied. If they declined, I had to firmly repeat my offer, followed by the same silent stare. If they declined a second time, I thanked them politely and went on my way. The goal was not to get a discount but to practice saying things to people that I knew they would not want to hear. This worked, sometimes too well: since the crafts on sale were often painstakingly produced by the people I was negotiating with, my lowball offers did not just discount the price — they discounted the creative output of the vendors themselves. As a result, my negotiation partners were not just disinterested in my offers, but often visibly insulted by them.Unusual conversations involved approaching strangers and saying or doing things that, while unthreatening, were downright weird. I began with easier challenges — asking someone on the street if they had a stick of gum or if they liked my shoes — and increased the intensity of the weirdness over time. By the last day, I had to ask a stranger for a sip of their drink, convince a tourist in the park that I knew them, and ask a line of people at a Starbucks to cut to the front without justification.¹The intent was two-fold: First, I hoped that by approaching strangers with highly uncomfortable requests, it would stretch my comfort zone, making more conventional approaches feel less daunting by comparison. Second, I guessed that the ability to take social risks — to be okay with other people thinking I was a bit weird — might be a prerequisite for the ability to tell people things they may not want to hear. If I were right, increasing my social risk tolerance would act like a rising tide, lifting all my other assertiveness ships along with it.I created 25 variations of each exercise, or 50 in total.² If I was averaging two or three opportunities for deliberately practicing uncomfortable conversations in the course of my normal life, I figured this would amount to about 25 years of life experience.I knew that doing these exercises would be scary and hard, so I leaned on a trick I learned from Cal Newport — the “grand gesture.” The idea is to tie a hard thing you’ve been meaning to do to something significant that breaks you out of your normal routine. J.K. Rowling booked stays in the Balmoral Hotel for $1,000 a night to help her complete the final book in the Harry Potter series. Bill Gates took “think weeks” at a cabin in the countryside to undertake deep thinking, away from the draws and distractions of everyday life.I took a week off work and flew from my home in Toronto to an Airbnb in East Harlem, a neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. Committing a nontrivial amount of time and money to the trip, combined with the reassurance that nobody there knew me, gave me the extra boost of intention to overcome the fear and complete the exercises. It also allowed me to structure the exercises as a bootcamp, so I could accumulate my 25 years of practice in only seven days.Fear loves discretion. En route to social events, I’d often promised myself to step out of my comfort zone and talk to strangers. But “talk to strangers” is a vague goal — Who is a stranger? How much talking do I have to do? — and given this wiggle room, my anxious brain would expertly craft credible reasons for why approaching people was impossible, or irresponsible, or a bad idea, and I’d bail.But take away this discretion — turn “talk to strangers” into a predetermined plan for the number of people you must approach and the specific questions you must ask them — and your brain’s deceptive power in the moment is neutralized. All the reasons you couldn’t or shouldn’t do the thing you were planning to do shrivel away, leaving behind only the bare bones of the thing that is holding you back — the fear.For this reason, I spent months before traveling to New York wrapping structure around the trip. I mapped out all the flea markets in the city and the dates I would visit them. I created detailed plans for the exercises I had to do each day, including scripts of what I had to say and spreadsheets to record what happened. The idea was to leave no space for discretion when doing the scary thing, so that when I was in the moment, it was just me and the fear.In addition to the conversations I had prepared, I started each day of the bootcamp with an extra exercise I’d read about from fear-facing expert Tim Ferriss. Every morning, I’d enter my local coffee shop, and after ordering my drink, I’d force myself to lie down on the floor in the middle of the store. For 20 seconds, with no explanation or advance warning, I’d lie there — eyes open, silently counting to 20 — as the rest of the café looked on in confusion. Then I would get up, pick up my coffee, and go about my day.It was an extremely weird thing to do, and each time I considered it, my social defense system would go into overdrive, firing every reason it was impossible or unreasonable or unsafe. Feeling the alarm bells go off, putting them aside, and doing the exercise anyway was a great way to start every day of the bootcamp with a small victory of courage over cowardice and set the tone for the rest of the day.Despite the large amount of time and energy I was investing into the trip, I told no one about it. My friends, family, and co-workers knew I was taking an unusually long holiday in New York, but that was it. I did this to avoid chickening out: Research shows that telling others about something difficult you want to do triggers many of the same emotional sensations as actually doing the thing. These sensations can then erode your motivation to actually achieve your goal — because by telling people, you’ve already obtained the identity you were striving for. To mitigate this risk, I kept the whole thing a secret until I returned.During the bootcamp I often felt anxious or uncomfortable, but I never felt unsafe. Part of this came from a set of ground rules I followed — avoiding doing the exercises at night, for example — but another part came from something I got for free: the fact that I am a white man. My privilege afforded me the ability to deliberately place myself in situations that could have turned confrontational without fear of repercussion or physical violence. While the intention of this essay isn’t a commentary on race — anyone can have difficulty with uncomfortable conversations — it is important to acknowledge that were I not a white man, the world may have reacted differently to these behaviors. Sadly, the reality today is that it is not always safe for everyone to embark on a journey like mine.I completed the bootcamp this past October. The trip was extremely impactful, mostly in ways I didn’t expect. Here’s what happened:The bootcamp lived up to its name — it was grueling. I woke up every morning dreading the day ahead, cringing at the list of uncomfortable conversations I’d have to have. I spent large chunks of time sitting in flea markets or on park benches with my head in my hands, working up the courage to initiate a conversation that my internal social compass told me was an extremely bad idea. The experience felt a bit like binge-watching Curb Your Enthusiasm, but instead of Larry David saying painfully awkward things to strangers, it was me.In fact, the most surprising part of the experience was how violently my body and brain would revolt when I pushed myself to act like Larry. When I would offer an unfair price to a flea market vendor or ask a line of polite people to cut to the front of the queue, the shock to my system was intense. I felt a wallop to my nervous system as intense as physical pain, and after the experience was over, I felt as drained as though I had just gone for a hard run. After each exercise, I needed nearly 40 minutes to regain the energy to get back in the ring for the next one. And the pain I felt when acting like a jerk didn’t decline much, even after repeating the exercises over and over again for a week.This is probably a good thing. The things I was doing were explicit violations of the social contract: making unfair bargains, asking for things I didn’t deserve, or generally acting unpredictably with others. These are things that I could force myself to do as one-off experiments but are not behaviors I ever want to get used to doing. It was fascinating — and frankly, reassuring — to experience that I probably never could get used to doing them, even if I wanted to; the electric collar of our human instincts is just too strong to overcome.While I never acclimatized to acting like a jerk, the exercises did translate to a meaningful boost to the skill I set out to improve — my ability to have uncomfortable conversations. Since returning to Toronto, I’ve found myself significantly more capable navigating conversations that I previously would have fumbled. In the months since I’ve returned, I’ve provided tough, constructive feedback to direct reports without stumbling through my words. I’ve advocated for controversial strategic decisions to strong-willed colleagues and prevailed. And I’ve approached countless strangers — some for practice, some for important questions or introductions. The results have been overwhelmingly positive. My ability to influence has increased, and my personal and professional relationships have improved. AQ really is a superpower.I think the boost to my AQ has come from three key changes that occurred over the course of the bootcamp. The first is a heightened awareness of how my brain and body react when I engage in a socially uncomfortable interaction. By repeatedly triggering my own anxiety, I’ve learned to recognize the physical and mental sensations that reliably come along with it: the heat and tension in my chest and temples, the images of the expected rejection that play on my mental movie screen, and the emotional pang urging me to avoid, agree, or do whatever is necessary to restore harmony between myself and the person I’m engaging with.Previously, these sensations would occur beneath the blanket of my subconscious, triggering an automatic flight response without any opportunity for my rational brain to intervene. Now, I can usually catch these sensations as they occur, providing me with a precious few seconds to consult my rational brain before my animal instincts react. This brief window is just enough time to ask myself whether my reaction is justified and, if not, to regain control of the machine — to reset my eye contact, organize my thoughts, and effectively deliver the message I was intending. This improved awareness is probably the biggest driver of my AQ gains thus far.This new awareness is complemented by the second change: a more realistic expectation of how people will react when I engage with them. Historically, hanging on a bulletin board in the deep recesses of my subconscious was a memo that read: PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO BE AGREED WITH AND LEFT ALONE. But my experience in New York proved that wasn’t true.Most strangers politely engaged with even my weirdest requests: The man in the coffee shop agreed to let me try a sip of his drink (I declined), the tourist in the park kindly engaged in my investigation of how we might know each other (we didn’t — he was from Australia), and not a single person in the Starbucks line rejected my request to jump ahead. Of course, the responses of cautious strangers are not perfect predictors of how people will respond in real-life interactions, but the upshot still matters: My projections for how people will react to being approached or challenged are often much worse than the reactions actually are. Now when I ask my rational brain whether the thing I’m about to say will upset the person, I’m much more likely to get the answer right.Finally, surviving the bootcamp has resulted in a newfound confidence to initiate uncomfortable conversations in the first place. My experiments at the extreme end of the AQ spectrum have increased my social risk tolerance, making normal, run-of-the-mill awkwardness seem almost blasé. Once you’ve asked a line of impatient New Yorkers to get your coffee before theirs, summoning the courage to provide respectful feedback to a co-worker feels a bit like a layup. The old adage about your comfort zone is true: The further you stretch outside of it, the more it stretches to meet you there.Shortly after returning from New York, I was called into a meeting at work to discuss an urgent issue about a project I was responsible for. The organizer of the meeting — a peer in another department who was known to have a short fuse — was concerned about the issue and demanded that one of my teams drop everything to fix it. When I surfaced my concerns with this plan — the team had already committed to another deadline — he lost his cool, exploding into bluster and dismissing my concerns in irritated exasperation. The room tensed up, and everybody looked to me for how I would react.This was the moment I had been training for — head-to-head conflict with an aggressive opponent — and the perfect opportunity to flex my new AQ muscles. But I was shaken by being yelled at, hurt by his condescending tone, and in the moment, I stumbled. Instead of observing my own discomfort, consulting my rational brain, and then calmly and respectfully voicing my disagreement like I had practiced, I reacted too quickly, responded too agreeably, and ultimately downplayed my concerns. After the meeting was over and my head was clear, I realized this was a mistake and had to schedule a time-consuming follow-up meeting to relitigate the whole issue. I had failed.I wrestled with early failures like this one a lot in the first few weeks after the trip. I had put everything I had into improving my assertiveness. I flew to New York City. I had a lifetime of painful conversations. I spent every morning on the floor of a hip East Harlem coffee shop, publicly humiliating myself. And still, I wasn’t as assertive as I wanted to be. What did this say about the impact of the trip — was all of that discomfort for naught? Or more precisely, was the optimistic philosophy underpinning the entire exercise — that deep-seated aspects of our character are as pliable as a tennis swing — naive? Was I stuck the way I was?I eventually found the answer hiding in the words of my own question. If I, a novice tennis player, signed up for a weeklong bootcamp to improve my backhand, I wouldn’t expect to return home ready to dominate at Wimbledon. That would be ludicrous; everyone knows that mastering a skill takes years, even with intensive practice. So if I was modeling my assertiveness training on traditional athletic improvement, why was I expecting the results to be any different?Put more scientifically, in constructing my bootcamp, I had recruited the first half of Ericsson’s research on expertise — that with the proper application of deliberate practice, humans can get good at anything. But when extending that theory from acquiring a technical skill like a tennis swing to a social skill like assertiveness, I forgot to include the second half of Ericsson’s findings: that mastery takes a tremendous amount of time.“Expert performers,” writes Ericsson in Peak, his 2016 opus on how great people become great, “develop their extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step by step in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts.”In other words, far from invalidating my philosophy, the bootcamp — and my experience in the weeks and months that followed — have cemented it, albeit with a sobering dose of reality. Our abilities, be they motor skills like a tennis swing or social skills like assertiveness, are profoundly malleable, with enormous upward potential and a ceiling we don’t know and can’t predict. But skills are skills, and there is no weeklong exercise or secret hack to short circuit the path to mastery. There’s only one way to get there — and that’s to keep setting up the ball machine.Special thanks to Rachel Kattapuram, Jamie McDonald, Jamie Shulman, Zack Belzberg, Eli and Alex Gladstone, Noam and Yael Pratzer, Talia Schlanger, Geoff Gualano, Liam Kearney, Vanessa Chung, Mark Shiner, Laura Shiner, and Micah Vernon for reading early drafts of this essay.[1] I got many of the ideas for the unusual conversations from Jason Comely’s Rejection Therapy game, designed to help players get more comfortable with rejection by asking strangers to do things they will almost certainly decline.[2] Because of logistical challenges, I only ended up having time for 21 uncomfortable negotiations. I made up for it by having four extra conversations with strangers to ensure I hit my total of 50 conversations. These extra conversations included several normal conversations, such as asking people where they suggested I visit in the city or where they purchased their laptop case. I realized that by having exclusively weird conversations with strangers, I was at risk of conditioning myself to expect others to respond negatively to my advances. Balancing out my unusual conversations with a handful of normal conversations felt like a healthy way to ensure I didn’t finish the bootcamp more uncomfortable than I started.'], ['Sovereignty and the Ocean', 'World Ocean Forum', 'Oct 1', 'https://thew2o.medium.com/sovereignty-and-the-ocean-87466b8667ea?source=home---------201------------------0----------', 'According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, sovereignty, in political theory, is the ultimate overseer or authority in the decision-making process of the State and in the maintenance of political and social order. It is a big word, powerful, assured, pompous, as if it embodies and imposes a final certainty, a right, divine, imperial, dictatorial, the final assertion of one thing over another. The voice of sovereignty is morally certain, a final resolution of the unquestionable order of things.The idea of a sovereign is top of mind these days with the death of the long-reigning Queen of England, ironically having little or no political or moral authority over her subjects, but still a transfer of the agency of authority and order to government subject thereafter to chaotic negotiation and conflicting interests that in so many instances today have paralyzed our ability to decide or to exercise our capacity for change. Sovereignty has become a pole in the clash of opposites, not a debate but a contemporary standoff between extremes — my way, not yours — and there can be no compromise or commonality between.What about Commonality? Commonality is the state of sharing features or attributes, a function of equitable choice and utility. The ocean is a commonality of interests to be shared by all, and today’s ocean conflicts are the result of an indifference to the interests of others with an equal claim, or equity, in marine natural systems, resources, future potential and benefit for everyone connected worldwide by the sea.There are two extremely important ocean examples where the opposition of sovereignty and commonality collide: first, the UN Treaty for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and second, within it, a treaty for the management of the high seas and seabed, the vast areas outside boundaries of national jurisdiction, negotiations for which were recently stalled at the UN over questions of state autonomy and collective action.The United States is one of the few nation states that has not ratified the UNCLOS agreement by a vote of the US Senate which has on many occasions failed to approve the treaty for its alleged violation of American sovereignty, a national claim on ocean systems, including oil and gas reserves, seabed minerals, biodiversity and marine genetic resources. Just as the nation asserts its rights of passage on the ocean surface, it also asserts its control over the water column and seabed even beyond the accepted limits of national economic interest. The US is not alone. Russia, for example, has extended its claims to over 70% of the Arctic Ocean, overlapping claims by the US, Denmark and Greenland, Norway, and Canada. To make the point, on August 7, 2007, the Russians went so far as to plant their national flag on the seafloor, under the ice, under the North Pole, a defiant geopolitical stunt and expression of sovereignty that has yet to be resolved.In the UN high seas treaty negotiations this month, similar divisions became apparent, conflicts over management of marine protected areas, environmental impact assessments, accountability for harm to the seabed biodiversity, and sharing of benefits derived from seabed mining of rare metals and genetic materials. If you look carefully, you will see recurring patterns of focus: extraction, exploitation, commercialization, exclusionary practice, and indifference to conservation and sustainability that underlie comparable past applications that are at the center of the various international climate agreements intended to decrease and redress the outcome of such actions on land. It seems we come to this point again and again: in our attempt to advance new approaches to our engagement with natural resources still remaining, we are stalled by the inevitable questioning of past authority, the dilution of past sovereignty, and the resistance to the commonality inherent in an ocean that serves us all equally and holds almost all the potential for our future food, energy, freshwater, health, and security. Are we really so committed to the mistakes of our past that we would knowingly fail to embrace our future?Sovereignty must no longer be the ultimate authority of the state. We must now live in a world of commonality in which equity is shared and the resources for survival are not privatized, copyrighted, patented, or excluded for the profit of the sovereign only over the compelling needs of the commons. We can choose to do this; we can ratify UNCLOS to enable; we can negotiate governance of the high seas with common good and equitable benefit in mind.Nature is sovereign; the ocean rules.PETER NEILL is founder and director of the World Ocean Observatory, a web-based place of exchange for information and educational services about the health of the world ocean.

When she died, I mostly saw memes mocking her death or YouTube celebrities claiming credit for having killed her. So, when I saw that conservative thinker Jordan Peterson made a video discussing the institution of the British constitutional monarchy, you know I leapt at it.Jordan Peterson makes a very interesting argument in favor of the British monarchy. He considers it a “fourth branch” of government, the “symbolic branch,” that essentially checks the authority of the executive. He sees the presidency in the United States as highly problematic, with an unbearable level of celebrity that has recently materialized in the worship surrounding the Trump family.Basically, without an actual monarchy, Jordan Peterson thinks that people substitute the president’s family as a sort of quasi-royal family. This is most clearly embodied by the Kennedy family’s “Camelot” myth, a term invented by Jackie Kennedy to immortalize her husband’s administration as a period of legendary, righteous, and glamorous power. I don’t think his characterization of the pantsuit-wearing Hillary Rodham Clinton as a “queen” makes as much sense, but her political career was kicked off by her husband’s presidency in a way that perhaps wouldn’t happen under Canada or the UK’s “four branch” system.Jordan Peterson sees peril in political figures like Kennedy and Trump being elevated to demi-royal status. He thinks that level of celebrity makes leaders and the people around them irrational or even delusional. This is why he has so much admiration for the monarchy. The Queen, as ultimate celebrity and symbol of the British Commonwealth, acted as a counterbalance in humbling charismatic prime ministers, who must defer and even confess to her for guidance and wisdom.With her 70 years of political experience, Peterson feels her death is an enormous loss to the world. More than just a lightning rod for celebrity, the Queen was a guiding light embodying nearly a century of British values and progress. Peterson has some apologia for the British Empire, which I won’t go into any more than mentioning that while he brings up India as a government that inherited the “great democratic tradition” of the British Commonwealth, I have never met an Indian person who had anything positive to say about the British.While listening to his argument, it struck me as somewhat similar to a point I made in an article recently. The article was about the United States being ignorant of the effects inflation and rising gas prices have across the world, and how they blame one man, Joe Biden, for what is actually a global phenomenon that the United States is experiencing a fairly light version of. I blame this in part on an American worship of the presidency, comparing it to the Imperial Chinese “mandate of heaven” concept.So, do I agree with Peterson? Not really. While I don’t know what it’s like living in a commonwealth with a symbolic monarch, as an American I find the Trump situation to be exceptional and a result of a deeply entrenched social issues. It would probably not help if the tension revolved around the living monarch instead of our spiritual “founding fathers.”As a counterpoint, Spanish fascism originated around reactionary movements to return the prestige of the Spanish Empire under the power of the Catholic Church and the Spanish Crown. The law of succession in 1947 declared Spain to be a Catholic, social, and representative monarchy. Dictator Francisco Franco appointed King Juan Carlos as his successor after his death in 1975, who led the transition to democracy instead of maintaining Franco’s regime. King Felipe VI is currently head of state and commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces.I will point out that the rise of fascism in both Germany and Spain followed the abolition of the monarchy. This may seem to support Peterson’s point, except that the religious cult around Emperor Hirohito was the symbolic core of Japanese fascism, whereas Italy, the home of fascism, didn’t abolish the monarchy until after democracy was reinstated. Japan actually had a period of semi-democratic constitutional monarchy prior to World War 2, but this quickly collapsed. This is all to say that unsurprisingly, monarchism doesn’t have much of a track record in stabilizing democracy.Peterson doesn’t seem to understand the problem people really have with the monarchy. He mentions that the royal family has had many scandals as a possible counterpoint, and then dismisses it because all families have scandals. A fixation on scandals, however, really seems to stem from a pro-monarchy standpoint. Rather than criticizing the institution itself, it recoils at the behavior of a few individuals who do not exemplify the values the monarchy is supposed to uphold as the symbolic branch of the Commonwealth. Expecting the royals to be a model family is a result of buying into the ideological underpinnings that legitimize its rule.The problem people in my neck of the woods have with the royal family is precisely its symbolism. Its legitimacy relies on ancient beliefs about “bloodlines” and aristocracy. It’s an embodiment of the idea that some people are inherently better than others because of their genetics. In an age increasingly defined by the tyranny of power and wealth concentrated in a few hands, royal children are born into extravagance and influence regardless of their individual merit.Let’s compare this with what Peterson sees as America’s partial replacement for the Queen: Hollywood celebrities. Peterson thinks it’s a problem for superstars to be seen as paragons of virtue, but that it’s better for them to take on the celebrity role than politicians. Ignoring the question of why he thinks that it’s fine for monarchs to be role models but not actors, he doesn’t go into what the differences between the symbolic meaning of these two entities are, which is curious since he seems to care very much about symbolism.Let’s take the Kardashians, perhaps the most reviled celebrity family in the world. The Kardashians started out with Tatos Kardashian, an Armenian man who had already escaped persecution before emigrating from a small village in the Russian Empire to the United States right before the Armenian genocide. From there, he started up a trash collection business, beginning a lineage of successful business ventures that led to Kim Kardashian’s breakout. Donald Trump appears to have a somewhat similar story, descending from a German lawyer who changed his name from Drumpf during the Thirty Year’s War, his descendants establishing themselves as winegrowers over a hundred years later.This is to say that our celebrities symbolize the American Dream, or in Trump’s case, the rise of Capitalism. Actors in particular are people who have persevered and come up on top in one of the most competitive industries on the planet, largely through their own hard work and talent. As someone who claims to care so deeply about meritocracy, you would think Jordan Peterson would have more respect for these individuals than the descendants of landlords who happened to be lucky in killing and marrying the right people.In fact, an actor like Ben Affleck, someone Peterson might just think of as an irritating woke moralist, arguably has much more of a right to participate in the political sphere than Jordan Peterson himself, based on his own criteria. Whereas Peterson spent most of his life in academia, Ben Affleck has worked all sides of the film industry, traveled the world, cofounded a nonprofit providing grants for Congolese community-building initiatives, done many different kinds of charity work, appeared as a panelist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cofounded his own film and television production company, and John McCain even considered him a credible and remarkable expert witness on Africa when he testified before Congress.Like so many of his ideas, Jordan Peterson’s analysis of the monarchy, while having the immediate appearance of being interesting and profound, is ultimately not very well thought out. Perhaps the very sad state of conservative thought nowadays has something to do with the same cult of celebrity he fears in others.Peterson fails to investigate important questions about celebrity. Besides not discussing what different celebrities symbolize or ought to symbolize, he seems to take for granted that celebrity must exist for a society to remain symbolically stable. Because of this, he doesn’t question whether having such enormous celebrity is actually good for us.Unlike him, I think hierarchy is generally bad, and celebrity is a very obvious form of social hierarchy that can be especially perilous and arbitrary. Perhaps it cannot be avoided on some level. After all, plenty of anarchist-leaning movements, where you would expect celebrity to be rejected, are known primarily by their charismatic leaders, Makhnovia and Zapatismo being the classic examples. Perhaps as social creatures, we will always be haunted by the ghosts of charismatic “great men” like Sun Yat-Sen, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Thomas Jefferson, Karl Marx, Margaret Thatcher, and Simon Bolivar.Many of my articles recently have discussed the disastrous consequences that can come from basing a political project on a single force of personality. As someone who deeply fears charismatic but deadly figures like Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin, perhaps Jordan Peterson is hoping that the monarchy will act as a counterbalance to people who might otherwise take things too far. History shows that it will not; no less the former British Empire, which as Peterson himself admits has much to be ashamed of.Society does not have to be arranged around charisma. Some societies have explicit counterbalances to the rise of a charismatic leader. The Ju/’hoansi, for example, have no formalized leadership positions. This is supported by a tradition of insulting great hunters, who must remain humble. This has maintained an egalitarian society with equal decision making power among everyone for an astoundingly long time, maybe for thousands of years.A more extreme example of humility norms is found in the “Republic” of Tlaxcala, a rival to the Aztecs that had lasted a few hundred years before being conquered by the Spanish. This society was notoriously proud for having no King, and candidates for the collective governing council had to undergo a grueling process of humiliation and self-abasement involving public insults, physical assault, isolated study, sleep deprivation, starvation, and bloodletting. Much of this was done in community plazas, where the common people could interact directly with their leaders.Besides documented societies, archaeologists are just beginning to develop theories on what they call “collective societies.” These are societies like the Indus Valley Civilization and Zapotec that lack monuments or art depicting any rulers, and where there isn’t a major discrepancy between the living situations of different classes of people, the largest structures being community buildings like bathhouses or even large open spaces where the common people may have interacted directly with their ruling class, like in Tlaxcala.Norms are incredibly powerful, and I don’t think it’s good for stability that our society has built such strong norms around boastfulness, arrogance, and star worship. Monarchy is an especially egregious and bizarre form of hierarchy and star worship, unique in its institutionalized power and subsidy from the government. The solution for humbling public figures is not to elevate others and hope things balance out, but to develop new norms that actually encourage humility. As members of a collectively governed society, we must develop ways to keep our rulers in check that prevent the degeneration into the despotic rule we’ve left behind.Also, to leave on a cheeky note:'], ['The body is not a machine', 'Antonia Malchik', 'Oct 16', 'https://antoniamalchik.medium.com/the-body-is-not-a-machine-d8ca3dc7549a?source=home---------140------------------0----------', 'The human body is subject to innumerable metaphors: Our brains are computers with immense processing power; our bodies are machines that need to be tuned and honed and oiled and optimized.But metaphors are just that — metaphors.

Johnson declared an “unconditional war on poverty in America” during his first State of the Union address. Johnson called for an all-out war against poverty and unemployment in the United States.” This involved a series of social programs enacted in 1964–1965 that were considered the most ambitious domestic policy initiatives since the Great Depression.For decades, political leaders and social scientists have debated whether Johnson’s antipoverty programs lifted people out of poverty or trapped them in chains of dependency.As an example, compared to 1964, the official poverty rate has dropped only modestly, from 19% to 15% in 2012. In 2020, the official poverty rate was 11.4%, up 1.0% point from 10.5% in 2019. It is the first increase in poverty in five consecutive years.In addition, nearly 11 million children in America live in poverty. In other words, one in seven children lives in poverty in this country, representing almost one-third of all poor people. Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, child poverty remains alarmingly high.So, what hasn’t the cycle of poverty been broken since President Johnson’s declaration? Despite the fact that there is no single answer, it isn’t dependent on an individual’s characteristics and choices. Rather, generational poverty is about lack of opportunity.Over the past few decades, developmental science has changed the way it understands child poverty. For children, poverty means more than living with fewer necessities. Poverty, especially at its extremes, can adversely affect the development of the body and mind. There is an increased risk, extending into adulthood, for many chronic illnesses and a shorter life expectancy for children living in poverty.Growing up poor increases children’s chances of having poor health, including emotional and behavioral problems, even when poverty doesn’t directly alter their biological systems. Children are exposed to multiple threats to their well-being when they live in poverty. In addition to a lack of “food security,” poor children have diets that are deficient in important nutrients. There are higher rates of chronic health conditions among poor children, including asthma.Despite this, they tend to receive less preventive dental and medical care. In April 2021, a study reported that parents whose incomes did not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) were more than nine times more likely to be uninsured.The National Council found that “Forty-two percent of the population saw cost and poor insurance coverage as the top barriers for accessing mental health care. One in four (25%) Americans reported having to choose between getting mental health treatment and paying for daily necessities.”People living just above the poverty line are particularly affected by this disparity between cost and need.Health Affairs explains, “not all low-income people with serious mental illnesses are eligible for Medicaid because they aren’t disabled enough to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI); they don’t meet other Medicaid eligibility criteria (such as single adults or immigrants), or they are homeless, incarcerated, or too ill to follow through with the enrollment and eligibility process.With states shifting an increasing proportion of their mental health budgets onto Medicaid, fewer state funds are available to provide services for low-income uninsured people with serious mental illnesses who are not eligible for Medicaid.”Creating and widening achievement gaps.When compared with their economically secure peers, children who grow up in poverty are far behind. From infancy onward, there are significant gaps in the development of learning, knowledge, and social-emotional skills. Leaving these early gaps unaddressed will lead to progressive widening. When optimal development is achieved early, further optimal development is possible, whereas when poor development is achieved, these doors are closed.Consequently, poor children lag behind their peers at the beginning of kindergarten, in reading ability in third grade, in self-monitoring skills in eighth grade, and in school attendance. Dropout rates are higher among poor children, and they are less likely to complete their education after high school.For example, schools with high poverty offer fewer advanced courses and fewer experienced teachers. Additionally, fewer dollars are spent on instructors and instructional materials per student.According to the above, high-poverty students receive fewer resources in the classroom than their peers outside of school buildings. These effects are disproportionately felt by students of color.In Virginia, for example, 16% of teachers in the state’s high-poverty schools were in their first or second year of teaching. Furthermore, teachers in high-poverty schools earned about $46,000 compared with over $57,000 in low-poverty schools in 2013–2014.In addition, high-poverty middle and high schools tend to have fewer advanced courses than schools with low concentrations of poverty. As an example, most middle schools with low poverty concentrations (93%) offered Algebra I, while only three-quarters (75%) of middle schools with high poverty concentrations did. In order to establish foundational math skills and prepare students for higher-level math, this course is crucial.Math and science aren’t the only subjects involved. In high-poverty schools, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) classes are less likely to be offered.Income inequality has also fueled a class-based social disconnect that’s led to unfair educational outcomes.“Now, your family income matters more than your own abilities in terms of whether you complete college,” said Robert Putnam, the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS). “Smart poor kids are less likely to graduate from college now than dumb rich kids. That’s not because of the schools, that’s because of all the advantages that are available to rich kids.”As a matter of fact, 46 percent of 2020 graduates from high-poverty high schools went to college that fall, compared with 70 percent from low-poverty high schools.Although poor families have many strengths, they also face numerous challenges that can affect their emotional well-being and that of their children. Compared to higher-income parents, poor parents report more stress, aggravation, and depression symptoms. Providing for their families’ material needs can be difficult for parents who do not have sufficient economic resources.It is also less likely that children in poor families have access to books and other educational resources at home, as well as activities, outings, and programs that can enhance their learning opportunities. There is a greater likelihood of housing instability in their families.Further, poverty makes it difficult for parents to maintain a work-life balance that allows them to spend time at home with their children and to be active in school, extracurricular activities, and community activities. Working long hours in a precarious job, without parental leave, sick pay, and other basic support, is more likely for parents on a low income. The flexibility and choice of low-income workers are often limited. For example, they use public transportation and cannot work from home.However, many experimental studies have demonstrated that increasing family income improves the social and academic outcomes of children.Lack of finances makes it difficult for parents to raise their families and live independently. Having poor eating habits, lacking confidence, and optimism can spread to children because parents are their closest role models.As a consequence of the perception of scarce resources, this behavior is also a part of the scarcity mindset.” This mindset traps people in a cycle of insecurity and a struggle to achieve short-term goals.In other words, a scarcity mindset is caused by a perception that resources are limited. Because the bandwidth in our brain is limited, we cannot solve two problems at once.As such, without meeting your current needs, investing in the future is impossible. Planning ahead is also difficult when you have limited funds and are focused on the short term. It would just be like buying the same pair of cheap shoes over and over again instead of investing in a pair of high-quality shoes.There is no doubt that this will have a huge impact on your life. First of all, if you’re worried about running out of money, you stay where you are. Secondly, low-income individuals who thought about a high car repair bill had significantly impaired cognition.As a Jean-Paul Sartre quote goes, “Introspection is always retrospection.” By looking back to the origins of our beliefs about money, we can change our generational patterns of money,” says Dr. Katherine Elder co-founder of Delaware Psychological Services. “Sometimes these patterns exist throughout several generations.”On average, raising a child can cost more than $200,000 over the years, even before higher education costs are considered. As families grow, expenses increase. But the largest expenses often occur far before their peak earning years. Although families across income levels face this challenge, those with the least resources face the greatest financial hardship.Since America’s current policies do not guarantee an adequate standard of living for children, their economic security is directly influenced by their caregivers’ experiences in the labor market. Over the past few decades, caregivers’ work has largely driven changes in child poverty rates.Over the past few decades, even during periods of economic growth, child poverty rates have remained high. Additionally, there has been a dramatic increase in income inequality since the 1970s. Because of this, in 2019, only 3% of total household income went to the poorest 20 percent of Americans, while more than half went to the richest 20 percent.It is estimated that the richest 5 percent had 248 times as much wealth in 2016 as those in the middle of the distribution. In comparison, the poorest 20 percent had no wealth or even negative wealth due to debt.Families across the country suffer from persistent poverty due to rising inequality. However, poverty would have been significantly lower had all families’ incomes grown at the same rate. For example, a U.S. Department of Agriculture report estimates that income inequality accounts for 93 percent of the increase in rural child poverty between 2003 and 2014. There are ramifications beyond just financial inequality. It also contributes to a disparity in child development markers and learning gaps.Economic vulnerability threatens millions of low-income children in families with at least one worker. It is estimated that over 15 million low-wage workers are raising children, and one in ten of these are single parents. The schedules of their jobs are unpredictable, employment is unstable, and they do not receive sufficient benefits or are not eligible for them.Furthermore, the quality of jobs has declined. As a result, job growth will be concentrated in the service sector, where workers in the hospitality, restaurant, care, and retail sectors are often paid less, receive fewer benefits, and do not have as many opportunities for promotion. It has been over a decade since the federal minimum wage was increased, even though low-wage workers saw the most wage growth in states that raised their minimum wages.Over 4 million fewer children would be in poverty in a full-employment economy if wages grew at the same rate as broader economic productivity.Currently, some people are advocating a two-generational model of poverty reduction, meaning that we can’t just focus on children without ensuring that parents have good employment, health, and life opportunities. Consistency is also important.If we want to improve our schools, we must act on it, not just talk about it. Investing at the local, state, and federal levels is essential, but neighborhood investments are also necessary.In spite of the multi-faceted nature of poverty, we can categorize it into two primary categories: culture and believing the lie of worthlessness.Poverty is caused by both internal and external factors in cultures. There are some conditions that are tangible and external, such as:There are also intangible and internal elements. For example, knowledge, aspiration, diligence, confidence, participation in governance, social capital, values, and peace are all important.People of low income often believe that they are failures, which is a lie of worthlessness. Their hope for a better future is hindered by this message of oppression and hopelessness. Due to previous generations living in poverty, the cycle continues and will continue for the next generation as well.Many people do not have a choice but to live in poverty. Most of those living in poverty work very hard to get escape. However, many are born into poverty (intergenerational poverty) and sacrifice their education for the sake of their families’ well-being..Some fall into it due to unexpected medical emergencies or other unforeseen circumstances (situational poverty). In many cases, they work hard at low-paying jobs that are stressful and demanding. Whether visible to you or not, people with disabilities, single parents, international students, veterans, and even your neighbor all face overwhelming obstacles.Children’s development and prospects for the future can be profoundly affected by economic hardship and other types of deprivation — and this affects the nation as a whole as well. Children with a low family income may have difficulties learning and developing cognitively. As a result, behavioral, social, and emotional problems may arise. Moreover, it can adversely affect the health of children. Children who experience severe and chronic hardship when they are young are those at greatest risk.Child poverty is not simply a matter of income. Families with low wages may experience fluctuating incomes due to the instability and unpredictability of their work. A child whose family is in unstable economic circumstances is more likely to suffer negative effects than a child whose family is stable.As well as being associated with difficulties later in life, these effects also contribute to problems in school, adolescent and adult health, employment outcomes, and poverty. Children who grow up in safe, nurturing, and enriching environments are more likely to succeed in school, and to become economically productive and responsible citizens.For children to thrive and grow into healthy, productive adults, parents need financial resources and human and social capital (basic life skills, education, and social networks).The list includes high-quality health care, adequate housing, stimulating early learning programs, good schools, money for books, and other enriching activities.Those facing chronic economic hardship are far more likely than their more affluent peers to suffer from severe stress and depression — both of which are detrimental to their children’s social and emotional development.A Shortage in Opportunity Leaves a Deficit Generationally was originally published on Due.com on Nov. 4, 2022, by John Rampton.'], ['Is it Autism or ADHD?', 'John Kruse', 'Oct 16', 'https://medium.com/invisible-illness/is-it-autism-or-adhd-56a1f0820b3d?source=home---------123------------------0----------', 'Autism spectrum conditions (ASD) and ADHD are our two most common neurodevelopment disorders, with the majority of individuals continuing to be affected into adulthood.

It seems that no one objects to bike lanes themselves, but they object to the reallocation of space that make safe bike lanes possible. Drivers seem to view roads as exclusively for them, and that any other proposed use is blasphemy. Note that most of this is specific to LA, but the objections (and retorts) are usually the same everywhere. Also, while I focused on bike lanes below, many of these same arguments can be made for bus lanes or neighborhood traffic calming. Here are some objections I’ve heard and how to overcome them:1. “You’re putting in bike lanes that no one uses anyway.” This is probably the most common thing I hear — that no one bikes in LA, so why bother putting in bike lanes. First, it’s not true that no one bikes, but it is true that most people don’t. The reason for this is that we have had a scattershot approach to adding bike lanes, and they don’t connect to each other, and are usually in the door zone. Therefore, they don’t form a safe network and don’t take people to where they need to go most of the time.THE RETORT: It’s likely not true that “no one” uses the bike lanes — but bikes are much quieter than cars and take up less space, so it’s easier to miss them go by. Also, since the city doesn’t have a network of bike lanes that actually make people feel safe (protected bike lanes), most people aren’t willing to risk riding their bike only for the lane to magically disappear, forcing them to share the road with speeding cars. By supporting more bike lanes, we can create a network of protected bike lanes, which once created, will be used by many more people that would otherwise likely be in a car.2. “LA is too spread out, it won’t work here. This isn’t Amsterdam.” This one is easy to talk to, as the statement assumes that every trip must start on one side of Los Angeles and end on the opposite side (and yes, that is likely too far to bike for most). But the vast majority of trips are possible.THE RETORT: While it’s true that not every trip in LA could be done by bike, 50% of car trips every day are going 3 miles or less (less than a 15 minute bike ride), 66% of car trips every day are going 5 miles or less (less than a 30 minute bike ride). People don’t need a to drive a mile to the grocery store, or two miles to run an errand — they do it because they feel like they have no safe alternative. Most people don’t like traffic or having to look for a parking space, and a bike solves both. But people are only going to use bikes if they feel like they’re not going to die in the street with poor infrastructure.3. “No one is going to ride to work, they don’t want to show up sweaty” or “no one is going to ride up a big hill,” or “no one is going to ride to carry heavy groceries home.”THE RETORT: E-bikes. E-bikes are the solution for those that live up a hill, or have a hilly commute, or need to carry something heavy. And with major e-bike manufacturers now offering e-bikes under $1,000, they can be true car replacements in hilly or heavy cargo situations.4. “You’re going to make pollution and traffic worse with idling cars stuck in gridlock if you take away a traffic lane.” This is a very common one, the myth that by giving people infrastructure for alternatives to the car, you’re just making pollution worse.THE RETORT: It’s true that if we put in non-car infrastructure and no one uses it, then traffic may get worse. However, case studies from around the world have shown the opposite. When cities make cycling safer and more attractive, a subset of the population decide to use the infrastructure, replacing a car trip. Over time, traffic actually gets better than before the change, with people doing a mode shift to a something that causes no pollution, is healthier, doesn’t wear down the road, and is much safer for those around them in the event of a crash.5. “There’s been no outreach on this project.” I think I’ve heard this line every single time I’ve been involved in a project that is even a little controversial. Here’s the hard truth: there will NEVER be enough outreach for people opposed to change. Usually, “outreach” is code for “I don’t like the project and want to use process to kill it.THE RETORT: In Los Angeles, thanks to NIMBY lawsuits against the City’s Mobility Plan 2035, the city is actually required to do a ton of outreach when considering a road reconfiguration on a major corridor. This usually results in multiple community meetings (both online and offline), tabling farmers markets, and sending mailers to homes near the street in question.6. “Bike lanes will mean emergency services can’t get through.” When the outreach excuse doesn’t work, some go to this one. It’s also completely false.THE RETORT: In cities with huge bike networks — many of which are in Northern Europe — you don’t hear of buildings burning down because the fire truck can’t get there fast enough, or of people having heart attacks and the ambulance not being able to get through. And these cities often have narrower streets than we do. In an emergency, it’s possible bike infrastructure could be used by an ambulance or fire engine — and in some parts of the world, there are bike paramedics that can arrive faster than their vehicular counterparts. In fact, LAFD even has a bike medics program. Bike lanes don’t stop emergency services.7. “You’re going to kill local businesses if you take away car space/parking.” People often protect parking spaces as if it’s their god given right to have free parking exactly in front of where they need to go at any time of day. But it’s not.THE RETORT: Study after study has shown the opposite — that when you calm traffic down, widen a sidewalk, add a bike lane, add trees, and make a street feel more like a Main St and less like a highway, people want to be there more and therefore businesses get more foot traffic. Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica is a great example of this. Here’s another recent study from New York City.8. “No one is going to bike when it rains / when it’s cold / when it’s hot.” LA has some of the most temperate weather in the world, so this is really a dubious excuse. Kids in Finland bike themselves to school on safe infrastructure in the snow! But when people are used to being ensconced in a vehicle, anything other than a controlled 72 degrees with no wind or sun can seem daunting.THE RETORT: The places in the world with the highest percentage of people riding bikes — Denmark, The Netherlands, France, Germany — have some of the worst weather in the word. In the words of one of my European friends, there is no bad weather, just bad dress. One of my favorite things to use in the rain is a Cleverhood — for the ~2 weeks a year it rains in LA. In the sun, I use a hat and sunscreen, and a newly purchased neck/ear protector. It’s all very doable.9. “I have kids, I can’t bike.” A very common one is that taking kids around by bike is impossible.THE RETORT: Electric cargo bikes solve this. Radpower has a large range of cargo bikes that accommodate one or two kids on one bike. Bakfiets — cargo bikes with the cargo in front — are also great. I personally have a Load 75, and it allows me to take my kids around pollution free, traffic free, and stress free. It has seats with seatbelts for 3 kids, a rain/sun shade, suspension, and up to 100 mile range. I also threw in a Bluetooth speaker and a fan into it, so they have “A/C” on hot days and music.10. “Cyclists don’t pay to use the road, I shouldn’t have to subsidize bike lanes.” This is one of my favorites — the idea that, because cyclists don’t, for example, fill up with gas and pay the associated sales taxes, that they don’t pay for their road use.THE RETORT: First, gas taxes alone don’t cover the cost of road maintenance. How is the difference between gas taxes and the true cost of road maintenance bridged? By general taxpayer dollars — through bonds, sales tax measures, property tax measures, and other general fund expenses. In other words, people that’s don’t drive subsidize road maintenance for those that do drive. To put a fine point on it, as cars have gotten heavier (both due to increase in size as well as batteries from electric vehicles), the roads have had to be repaved more often, making that gap even larger. Someone who bikes is actually doing drivers a favor — their tax dollars go towards repairing the road damaged caused by their heavy vehicle, while not contributing themselves to any wear and tear.11. “There’s no space for bike lanes.” This one is interesting, as humans decide how to allocate road space. If you went back 150 years ago, there’d be no such thing as space for cars — it would’ve been a mix of streetcars, horses, pedestrians, and cyclists. If you go back 100 years ago, the majority of space still wasn’t for cars. It was only post World War 2 that cities began to deconstruct their streetcar systems and the federal government began plowing highways through cities — all Destruction For Nada. This question was inspired by Evan Meckelnburg’s tweet about a county traffic engineer explaining why there wasn’t enough space for safe bike facilities on a street.THE RETORT: When someone says “there isn’t enough space” what they really mean is they don’t want to reallocate the existing space to another use. So then the question becomes, what percentage of the street is for cars? If it’s like most streets in most American cities — 100% — then the next question is, is that fair? Why should pedestrians and cyclists be pushed to the margins or be forced to share space with quickly moving 2 ton metal boxes? Why should the bus — which is far more efficient at moving people — be forced into sitting in traffic with private vehicles? Usually by asking these questions — if the person on the receiving end is honest about it — they will reflect and perhaps realize the inequity.12. “By taking away car space, you’re hurting disabled people that don’t have the luxury of biking.” This one has had a resurgence lately, especially with some of LA’s newest bike lanes. I was at an event last week celebrating the new parking protected bike lanes on San Vicente with Mayor Garcetti and two of my kids (on our way to biking to school) when a woman came up to the Mayor and starting telling him how the new bike lanes were a disaster for disabled people. But LADOT designs these facilites with ADA compliance in mind.THE RETORT: Not everyone has to bike or bike for every trip— and that’s ok! If someone is physically disabled so they’re unable to ride a bike, no one expects them to use a bike lane. The engineers that are designing the facility need to make sure they are designing it in a way that is compatible with disabled people’s needs. For example, with a parking protected bike lane, they should make sure any blue painted parking spots have curb ramps across the bike lane, and signage/paint in the bike lane so cyclists know to watch out for people crossing there. The two things aren’t incompatible, the bike facility just needs to be implemented thoughtfully. This question was inspired by Dan Federman’s tweet.The bottom line is that most objections to bike lanes are a result of uneducated opinions. It’s hard for people to imagine a different built environment than they’re used to. As advocates, instead of just yelling back, it behooves us to stay calm and give facts. It won’t win everyone over, but over time it will win the day.'], ['The Bird Is Fried', 'Dave Pell', 'Oct 29', 'https://davepell.medium.com/the-bird-is-fried-3c66d868abc5?source=home---------81------------------0----------', 'Oh, what Elon strange trip it’s been. After months of top of the news wrangling, Elon Musk celebrated the purchase of the company he was essentially forced to buy with the tweet, “The bird is freed.” So why do I feel like our goose is cooked? Journalists make up a large proportion of Twitter’s most active users and work in the world’s most self-gazing profession, so you’ll be seeing nonstop, top-of-the-page headlines about each move Musk makes at Twitter — which already includes the predictable firing of top execs — so I’ll spare you the blow by blow.Speaking of blow… In 1979, Victor Kiam appeared in a commercial for Remington shavers in which he proclaimed, “I liked the razor so much I bought the company.” That’s similar to the Musk/Twitter story, but Scarface is probably a closer analog. It was Michelle Pfeiffer’s Elvira Hancock who warned Al Pacino’s Tony Montana, “Don’t get high on your own supply.” Tony didn’t listen. Neither did Elon. Musk is a Twitter addict. This comment falls into the category of it takes one to know one. I’m a Twitter addict, too. Most of the platform’s active users are.Several years ago, I started using an app from Twitter called TweetDeck to track my likes and retweets — they call tools like these social media dashboards, but they’re better understood as the vital signs for an internet dopamine junkie. One of the options in the app is to hear a shrill, school alarm bell sound anytime anyone interacts with one of your tweets.Out of curiosity, I enabled the feature. The first ring startled. The second one went down a little easier. The third ring calmed. And after that, I needed the fourth ring. When the alarm bells went off in quick succession, it felt good, like a song I wanted stuck in my head. So, that day, I decided to leave the feature on for a little while.That was about a decade ago. Since then, anytime someone responds to me, mentions me, retweets me, likes one of my tweets, shares anything re- lated to my newsletter, NextDraft, or links to any of my other writing online, I hear the ring. And I experience a positive response each time. Ring, response. Ring, response. It’s like someone forgot to pick up after Pavlov’s dog.The bell has sounded so often, and has become such a pervasive source of background music in my house, that no one in my family ever even mentions it. It would be more noticeable if my laptop were open and there was no ringing. Every now and then, during a quiet, dry spell, one of my kids will hold a finger under my nose to make sure I’m still breathing.I’m a small-fry, just one of the millions of middling addicts. For guys like Musk, with more than a hundred million followers, the dopamine hits are like tidal waves. So he kept tweeting. He kept tweeting when it hurt his reputation, even among prospective Tesla buyers. He kept tweeting when it led to nasty lawsuits or huge SEC fines. Even with all the fame, pressure, and influence associated with being the world’s richest (and maybe most famous) person, Musk couldn’t resist the blue tweet button. It was this Twitter addiction that led Musk to publicly ponder the possibility of purchasing the platform. That thread got him in so deep he was ultimately forced to wildly overpay for a company that will endlessly distract him from the several other much more impressive companies to run. Now that’s a Twitter addiction. (On the plus side, I’m so bummed that Musk owns Twitter, it may actually help me kick my own habit.)Twitter is a bloated company that has often been poorly managed, both on the product and revenue fronts. So Musk and his fellow investors may very well see financial upside at some point. But, as it was for Tony Montana, the psychological upside will prove more elusive. $44 billion is too much to pay to own the libs. I keep picturing Musk at Twitter HQ yelling, “Say hello to my little friend.” But when you look, he’s just holding an iPhone with the Twitter app open.From Dave Pell’s Free Newsletter, NextDraft.'], ['Measuring Up: A Breast Cancer Story', 'Suzanne Johnson', 'Oct 3', 'https://medium.com/the-memoirist/measuring-up-a-breast-cancer-story-c0b2c85c463b?source=home---------181------------------0----------', 'How do I measure up?

Skylab, America’s first space station, was the largest spacecraft in history at that point. Astronauts traded the claustrophobic interior of the Apollo for the expansive new station, where they could eat “shrimp cocktail, filet mignon, sweet potatoes, creamed peas, and peach ambrosia” for dinner, sleep in their own quarters and take showers once a week.But six years into Skylab’s orbit, catastrophe loomed. As reported in the Washington Post, “unanticipated atmospheric turbulence, triggered by solar activity” began pulling the then-unmanned craft toward earth. Although the craft was not designed to land intact on earth — it was meant to disintegrate into the atmosphere — it appeared to be on its way back years ahead of schedule. People feared that early reentry of the craft could cause devastation and death. Families around the world in areas identified as vulnerable panicked, with farmers selling off livestock and in some cases unloading their property in order to relocate.The Institute for PsychoEnergetics in Brookline, Massachusetts, a grass-roots, private organization interested in unexplained phenomena, hatched an ambitious plan. “Our experiment is to see if the powers of the mind are strong enough to raise Skylab in its orbit,” said the group’s spokesman.The group hoped to stop Skylab from crashing into the earth by using psychokinesis. The term literally means “mind movement” and refers to the theoretical ability to affect change on matter through energy produced by the mind, while the similar term telekinesis posits a mental ability to cause matter to move without physical contact. “Skylab is now circling the earth in a descending spiral,” the Brookline-based group warned. “In one future it will crash into the planet. In another future it moves into a stable orbit.” Combining the population’s psychokinetic powers could “help us to push Skylab higher and higher.”The group partnered with WFTL-AM, a Fort Lauderdale radio station, in order to broadcast a mass psychokinetic event at 1 p.m. on Friday, May 25, 1979 with hopes of bringing a million minds together. That turned out to be a wild underestimate. With 42 radio stations across the world carrying parts of the collective psychokinesis, an estimated 12 million participated. The would-be telekinetics ran the gamut of backgrounds and ages. Children like 5-year old Kenji Ito, a Japanese boy in Yokohama, had grown up learning about Skylab and watching the sky in wonder, while the Skylab looked right back at them, snapping dramatic photos such as its views of Japan’s Island of Kyushu and the Sea of Okhotsk. Now the youthful thrills produced by Skylab turned to fear.In the radio broadcast, the participants were primed with a meditative introduction: “There is not one time, there are many times. You and all of us are at a point in time. From this point many futures exist, not just one.” The power of collective consciousness gave them the freedom “to choose which future to manifest out of many possible ones,” but “free will is not free, it takes energy.” Then came the long stretch of silence, an intense period of concentration by millions.The experiment lasted more than seven hours. NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston reported “absolutely no change” on Skylab’s orbit and, not surprisingly, the media pounced, mocking the participants. Two months later, Skylab careened through the atmosphere before mostly disintegrating into what a witness called “a spectacular fireworks show.” The remaining debris burned, mostly falling into the Indian Ocean and rural tracts of southwestern Australia where locals, reporters, and even Miss America, Mary Friel, searched for parts of the craft, none of which caused any injuries.The organizers of the collective telekinetic effort admitted to feeling like failures. But for those who scrutinized the event, there was more to it. Shortly before the group’s experiment, NASA’s models predicted Sklyab’s reentry would occur between June 15 and June 22. NORAD’s models had set a 90 percent probability that the station would reenter between June 13 and July 1. The actual reentry ended up being on July 11. This significant discrepancy was omitted or buried in press coverage. Whatever unexpectedly slowed the massive object down, the dramatic difference may have changed the trajectory and kept millions safe.The telekinetic endeavor remains unprecedented in recorded history for the sheer number of people mentally focused on one object. Part of the basis of scientific interest in psychokinesis is the notion that our brains’ functions are imperfectly understood and woefully underappreciated. Though the axiom that we use only 10 percent of our brain is a misconception, the complexity of the brain and consciousness remains a mystery even among neurologists.It was said the brain had untapped capacity to interact with molecules, ultrasonic waves and electromagnetic forces surrounding us. The ancient thinker considered to be the father of atomic theory, Democritus, born around 460 BCE, also crystallized theories behind psychokinesis. In fact, Democritus was said to have undertaken the first field investigations of the practice. He went into graveyards and in the desert, where he could achieve solitude and test his own ability to perceive telepathically. His findings in these experiments were never revealed.Skeptics laughed at the Skylab’s telekinetic hopefuls, but all the while scientists and officials from a wide swath of government agencies — including NASA itself — were seriously studying the potential of psychokinesis. A few years before Skylab streaked through the skies, at the 141st meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a warning sounded. Rex Stanford, a psychologist at St. John’s University, believed that psychokinesis was real and that an increase in interest was “dangerous.” Participants in experiments could become convinced they were “endowed with almost unlimited capacities to manipulate other people by psychic means… fixated on these possibilities.” By the calculus of believers, out of a sample size of 12 million people concentrating on Skylab, a few may have experienced something potent, something that knocked the wind out of them. The impact from millions of people zeroing in on that object would likely have been clumsy. But if an individual captured and controlled such powers, Stanford’s warnings could be realized sooner than expected.By the 2000s, those fears ignited into a race to contain what some called the most powerful weapon in the world: Brainwaves.In\\nthe spring of 2001, a researcher at the Marine Corps University named Loren Rick Bremseth, 50, prepared to shake things up. He had commanded Navy SEAL Team EIGHT, and would go on to have a major command tour at Naval Special Warfare Group THREE. Head-shaved, with a close-cropped mustache, he was tasked with handling sensitive material in tense situations at home and abroad. He was fond of one particular saying translated from 4th century Rome: “If you want peace, prepare for war.”He was known as a teller of hard truths. He served as the Deputy Senior Director of the Integration Support Directorate, where his role included being “responsible for the synchronization, facilitation, overall planning, coordination, and execution within the DON for Sensitive Activities, Irregular Warfare, and Special Operations Forces support.” In layman’s terms, he tracked global military techniques that the public probably would never know about, methods that transcended convention. He was liaison for these matters with various agencies and officials, including the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.Commander Bremseth defied stereotypes of the hard-charging warrior who relied on brawn and weaponry over brains — in fact, he suspected brains were a potential weapon. He believed that the military’s nearly 25-year investigation into psychokinesis, part of what was known within the government as Project StarGate, had quietly been a success. But since those days of Skylab, back when the US government had been aggressively (if stealthily) funding research in unconventional fields, government support by this point dwindled, and practically dried out.In April, Bremseth circulated a bombshell analysis titled “Unconventional Human Intelligence Support.” He diagnosed the reasons for the government’s pullback as “internal mismanagement” and political disinterest in being associated with “long-term unconventional or controversial programs.” Bremseth called the termination of cutting edge psychoenergetic research and development a “missed opportunity.” He challenged his colleagues: “Did the CIA terminate [it] because it feared potential ridicule by association[?]”Pushing back against complacency were data points from around the world. In a declassified briefing, Project Sun Streak (an offshoot of the StarGate program) considered secretive institutes and research groups that studied young subjects with anomalous abilities. Such programs existed around the world including in Holland, France and Argentina, as well as a laboratory in Japan devoted to evaluating and refining subjects’ abilities. Researchers in Canada had examined American Indian children, and in another North American study, one 8 year old, whose identity was kept anonymous, scored off the charts in tests designed and overseen by a Duke University professor to measure extrasensory perceptions.At a program in China, the star participants were two sisters, Wang Qiang, 13, and Wang Bin, 11, from Beijing. Results of university-led tests on the sisters were published in Ziran zazhi (Nature Journal), a respected Shanghai-based scientific journal. Researchers reported that the sisters telepathically “read” words, numbers and images without being able to see them. Telepathy — the concept of nonverbal communication or transfer of thoughts between minds — was an offshoot of telekinesis.In one experiment, the sisters were given a sealed container with a piece of paper inside. The sisters were then able to imagine the writing “on an inner mental screen,” a fleeting image that required extreme concentration. The girls would be so exhausted by the experience that they had to rest between sessions.From observations of telekinetic experiments, participants experienced intense respiration and heart palpitations up to 300 beats per minute. A military study that collated years of psychokinesis studies documented a woman who “suffered loss of weight, lack of coordination, dizziness, and vomiting, accompanied by bodily pain and sleeplessness,” while another woman after telekinesis sessions had “difficulty in speaking for a while afterwards, perspired freely and trembled, her eyes and nose ran.” Such physical and personal struggles could put military missions — and the individuals’ well-being — in jeopardy.The ancient Greek philosopher Democritus defied conventions of his time by insisting that men and women who were considered prophets were indeed receiving information but not from gods. Democritus’s vision of telepathy involved a sender’s “simulacra,” an invisible entity, reaching a recipient, and, as summarized by one modern commentator, “[the simulacra] acquaint him with the view, the calculations and the impulses of the individual who is their source.”Those who were emotionally frenetic, or perhaps those who could refine their ability to reach an almost fugue state, were the most likely to interface with these telepathic messages. The classical scholar E. R. Dodds found such the view prescient, as “a strikingly large proportion of telepathic dreams and hallucinations are reported as having occurred when the assumed agent was experiencing some physical or mental crisis.”American researchers Paul Dong and Dr. David Eisenberg visited the facilities in China to study the Wang sisters. The girls seemed typical — precocious, gum-chewing, “average” students in school — but the American observers reported that their abilities included “restoring a torn card, removing pills from a medicine bottle by mind power, psychic writing, restoring broken chinaware, mineral prospecting, and healing.” When Chinese officials learned that the Americans had met with the sisters, they were not happy, cutting short their findings.The Chinese military and government thought that gifted children were at risk of losing their skills over time — or at least losing control over those skills — so they instituted a program where students between the ages of 15 and 20 would undergo more rigorous training. A CIA report, declassified in 2000, noted that one researcher, Yang Chao-Tong, addressed the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Human Science Research Commission in Neimenggu, and “suggested adding attached middle schools to traditional Chinese medicine universities and colleges, and consciously accept a number of children with psychic abilities, cultivating them in depth.” Such cultivation aimed to turn those abilities over to the military.When Bremseth submitted his 2001 report holding his peers’ feet to the fire, he was in a unique position to draw interagency attention. Bremseth put a fine point on the stakes of falling behind the curve: the government’s “inability to conceptualize transcendent warfare and to effectively develop/employ creative asymmetrical responses to dynamic environments will be recognized and exploited by our adversaries.”K\\nenji Ito, who had been too young when growing up in Japan to understand the fuss around attempts to telekinetically affect Skylab, by now was in his twenties and living in London. Records of Ito’s childhood, which overlapped with the rise of Japanese laboratories studying psychokinetic tendencies in young subjects, remains difficult to piece together. He grew up disconnected from his surroundings, with a noticeable edge to his personality. A reporter who encountered him as an adult described Ito as having “a wisp of facial hair and a usually serious demeanor.”While living in the Camden Town district, he began to feel peculiar. His head felt heavy, as if he was experiencing the blurriness of a dream while still awake. “Hypnotized,” he described it, but that didn’t quite capture his experience.He felt as if there was someone else near him, or even inside his mind — the feeling arriving like a wave against his brain. He struggled to explain it to his wife, while worrying what she would think. Ito was far from other family and support systems. As Commander Bremseth had raised in the military context, anyone bringing up unexplained mental phenomena risked abandonment in their personal and professional lives.A\\nfew months after Bremseth’s report came the devastation of the 9/11 attacks. Overnight, assumptions of traditional warfare had to be questioned. A flurry of proposed legislation came before Congress, including H.R.2977, a bill titled the Space Preservation Act of 2001. The stated purpose of the bill was to “preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind by permanently prohibiting the basing of weapons in space by the United States, and to require the President to take action to adopt and implement a world treaty banning space-based weapons.”One particular section of the bill raised eyebrows. In addition to banning space-based weapons, prohibited items included “electronic, psychotronic, or information weapons” as well as the deployment of “mind control” of “persons or populations.”At the same time, Dr. Franklin B. Mead, Senior Scientist at the Advanced Concepts Office of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate at Edwards AFB, wanted to understand the latest status of the field of psychokinesis. He commissioned a study centered on unconventional physics. Mead, 63, had a long and unusual career, best captured by an epigraph by T. E. Lawrence that he chose for a report on advanced propulsion concepts: “All men dream; but not equally… the dreamers of the day are dangerous men for they may act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible.” Commensurate with his philosophical approach, Mead had already flagged that the future of propulsion could include the use of psychokinesis, while other researchers conceived of psychokinesis being deployed to “bend [carbon steel] tank barrels.”Among aficionados of psychokinesis, mental abilities could be organized into categories borrowed from physics and biology indicating impact on different types of external matter. Telekinesis was used to describe a basic ability to move an inanimate object. Electrokinesis would control electricity, and photokinesis manipulated light. Hydrokinesis mastered water, while cryokinesis affected ice. Geokinesis controlled earth, and chronokinesis impacted time. Rather terrifying to imagine, virokinesis controlled diseases.The institutes around the world that had attempted to study and train children in telepathic techniques tended to be black boxes, making them difficult for officials like Mead to analyze. Unlike the fictional Xavier Academy in Marvel’s X-Men, children who went through real life programs were not nurtured or monitored outside experiments and tests. Some were shuttled back and forth between scientists and even between countries. The Japanese ESPER laboratory brought in highly touted “star subjects” from China, performing intense medical workups on them before permanently closing down. In China’s studies of EFHB (Exceptional Functions of the Human Body) girls who were highly touted for their abilities were believed to lose potency once they started menstruating and abruptly cut off from training. A young Russian who was studied intently in lab settings for abilities documented since her childhood, ended up celebrated before being quietly imprisoned. The individual who as an 8 year old shocked American professors with his scores on extrasensory tests pulled away from researchers once his school and home life became turbulent. Former subjects were left adrift, on their own, often confused about their own purported skills.As programs across the globe lost funding, closed down or changed locations, some participants had been too young to remember their experiences, and even their parents could be kept in the dark. The ex-students found themselves moving on — attending universities, entering the workforce and academia, pursuing politics and activism — without clear understanding of what they had been through and why. Moreover, according to Democritus’ ancient framework, those emotionally attuned to telepathic techniques could also be most vulnerable to being targeted by them; in other cases, the “brain waves” could be released by experimental subjects unintentionally.T\\nhe mandate to carry out Dr. Mead’s commissioned study fell to Dr. Eric W. Davis, a bespectacled, salt-and-pepper haired astrophysicist who taught at Baylor University and Prescott College, and who consulted the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Defense and NASA.Davis’s report keyed on emerging research from private citizens. One lone wolf scientist had “secretly operated” a telekinesis lab in Florida since the 1990s. Much more influential was the work of Dr. Robert G. Jahn, a physicist and Dean of Engineering at Princeton University who had founded its Electric Propulsion and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory. Jahn had a pedigree with the government, having conducted research with the Air Force and NASA.Jahn, along with researcher Brenda Dunne, a psychologist from the University of Chicago, founded the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR), which conducted psychokinetic experiments. The lab wasn’t glamorous, located “in what was previously a small storage area next to the machine shop in the basement of Princeton University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science.” Jahn was a rigorous scholar with an appreciation for the light-hearted. Regarding their unusual acronym, Jahn would explain that he and Dunne had been at lunch, and “noticed that the salt and pepper shakers were in the shape of pears, that the salad involved pears, and that the dessert menu featured pear cake.” This moment of “Jungian synchronicity” captured Jahn’s openness to revelation.From the start, the PEAR lab’s leadership believed that the key to understanding psychokinesis lay in a fundamental reformulation. Rather than imagining consciousness as being bound to our body, it was possible that consciousness had “a wave nature, metaphorically akin to that attributed to atomic-scale physical systems” — a striking echo of how Democritus envisioned simulacra transferring information between minds.Jahn was proud that the lab “represented an intellectual and spiritual refuge where [colleagues] could share ideas and experiences that were discounted, or even ridiculed, by their professional peers.” Visitors included representatives of the government and military, “some of whom identified themselves as such, and some who did not.” Many government officials whose agencies had gutted psychokinetic research programs, became invested in the work at PEAR, inviting Jahn and Dunne to confer with them. Davis took particular interest in Robert Jahn “attend[ing] a meeting” on psychokinesis “at the Naval Research Laboratory” where he “warned that foreign adversaries could exploit micro- or macro-PK [psychokinesis] to induce U.S. military fighter pilots to lose control of their aircraft and crash.”A crossroads emerged. Officials could choose to embrace a Congressional ban of psychokinetic experiments or, using the research being compiled by Mead and Davis as a springboard, could pave the way to new research — before a lack of oversight and understanding led to casualties.In\\nother countries, such as Romania, powerful figures openly recognized the influence of psychological anomalies. In 2004, the same year that the Davis-Mead report was released by the Air Force, Adrian Năstase was favored to win Romania’s presidential election, but claimed that he was struck by “an attack with negative energy” — a psychic attack. Some laughed. Others suspected his opponent, Traian Băsescu, was behind a nefarious plot. Either way, Băsescu won the election.A few years later in another major campaign, Băsescu’s new opponent, Mircea Geoană, alleged that Băsescu was receiving guidance and power from an academic named Aliodor Manolea. Sporting a closely-cropped beard and a stout frame, Manolea seemed to carry the air of his former time in the Romanian army. He had two doctorates, one in psychology and another in military science, fusing together a formidable skillset. Manolea apparently made “strange” movements that were interpreted to be psychokinetic in nature. Manolea responded that he was merely coaching his candidate, noting that Băsescu had been “too passive and negative” in his public speaking.But Geoană and his camp were well-aware of Manolea’s reputed psychokinetic talents because they, too, had hired him to work on a campaign for parliament two years earlier, seeking the same advantages. Manolea’s scholarly work openly focused on what he called a transpersonal war, an “extension of human communication” in which “the emotional, somatic state and behavior of a person can be under the mental control of another person specifically prepared to perform this action without the need for a somatic [bodily] sensory contact.”At\\nPrinceton, PEAR continued implementing psychokinetic experiments, but under scrutiny.Tucked among the wood-paneled walls of the nondescript lab — covered with push-pinned photographs, schematics, lists and reminders — the researchers set up subjects or “operators” in front of random event generators, known as “electronic coin flippers,” that created randomized results. As explained by the PEAR staff, “left unattended, the machine performs in a statistically normal way.” Yet when the operator was present, “wishing for the output to be higher or lower,” there was a statistically measurable difference.In an experiment known as the Random Mechanical Cascade, a wall-mounted device that contained 9,000 black polystyrene balls dropped through a peg matrix and collected into various sections. Each section had an electronic counter that tabulated the numbers of balls that landed there. Left to run on its own, the balls would tend to collect in the center of the device, creating an almost hill-like formulation. Yet when certain operators sat on a couch across from the device and articulated intentions (“a little shift to the right”), researchers found a discernible difference from the typical results.In another experiment, the operator stood in front of a glass-fronted device that contained a linear pendulum with an illuminated sphere at the bottom. The bob would flow at a steady rate without human presence, but in certain instances, the “damping rate or symmetry of swing” could be measured to change with particular operators, some of whom stretched out their arms and swung their hands back as they intensified intense focus on the objects.Even a water fountain was observed to change its performance. As Jahn noted in one paper, the water’s “transition from a laminar stream to turbulent burbling,” or even its “degree of droplet scatter” were observed to fluctuate in the presence of certain operators.Unlike the sparse institutional decor in fictional depictions of psychokinetic experiments, Jahn described the atmosphere of the PEAR lab as “cheery, relaxed, even playful,” believing that psychokinetic experiences “are somehow nurtured in the childlike, limbic psyche and therefore could well be suppressed or even suffocated by an excessively clinical or sterile research environment” — hence the cartoons that decorated the walls among the scientific materials, and even stuffed animals that lined the couches.PEAR hoped to discover how focused human intention, via thought, could influence, disrupt, or otherwise change their surroundings. In a speech to the prestigious New York Academy of Sciences, PEAR’s Dr. Arnold Lettieri explained their methodology: “Our research protocol asks people to use their minds, in accord with each experiment’s protocol. This is why we call them operators instead of subjects.” By focusing on “untrained human operators,” PEAR could demonstrate that psychokinetic ability was endemic to the brain, laying dormant and waiting to be awakened.PEAR caught the attention of an especially vociferous and formidable critic, a colleague at Princeton. Dr. Philip W. Anderson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977, and began teaching at Princeton in 1984. He was known for essentially starting “solid state physics as a field.” Anderson went after PEAR on campus and in public. “I think I represent 95 per cent of the physicists I know in not believing that this kind of work is sound or worth doing.”Jahn insisted that their apparently unconventional work at PEAR was, in fact, conventional because the foundation of science was probing the unknown. “The study of anomalies is one of the most important weapons of science — it explains where we go wrong… We have every right to study it as much as we study electrons in a cloud chamber.”W\\nhile PEAR labs deflected adversaries in New Jersey, researchers in Turkey “conducting scientific studies” in consciousness and energy research reached a milestone. They were coming together from a wide range of fields for the First Istanbul Parapsychology Conference on May 14, 2005. The meeting promised to disseminate new studies and methods among colleagues, but it also prefigured explosive developments about to unfold.On August 8 the following year, Hüseyin Başbilen, a 31-year old mechanical engineer for ASELSAN, an influential defense corporation based in Turkey, was scheduled to present about his work on an ambitious new project: a sprawling, collaborative endeavor to design battle tanks for the Turkish Armed Forces. A graduate of Middle East Technical University, an elite university in Ankara, the capital city, his previous defense work included designing steel scopes that enabled sniper rifles to be used at night. He had just gotten married two months prior, and had high hopes for his future work and family, but he had occasionally complained of headaches.Başbilen never showed up for his presentation. He was found dead in his locked car, parked in the street roughly 50 meters from his house. His throat and wrists were slashed; the cut on his throat was nearly 20 inches long.The gruesome death was only the start of a series of mysterious deaths of talented ASELSAN employees working on various defense projects. Only four months later, the body of Halim Ünsem Ünal, a 29-year-old electrical engineer for the company, was found dead near Lake Eymir, also in Ankara, from a single gunshot to the head. Nine days later, Evrim Yançeken, another ASELSAN defense worker and electrical engineer, fell from the sixth floor of his apartment building. Yançeken was completing graduate work at the elite Middle East Technical University.The cases were all ruled suicides, but loved ones pushed back. Başbilen’s family insisted the young, brilliant engineer wouldn’t take his own life. Yançeken’s family also spoke out, acknowledging the young man was stressed about his thesis, but that he was doing exactly what he wanted in life.Months later, Burhanettin Volkan, an ASELSAN software engineer, started becoming paranoid. His father observed his son’s odd behavior: “My son seemed irresolute to me when he was at home. He thought he was being chased by snipers. He kept saying ‘boom,’ while pointing to his forehead with his finger like a gun. He once said that he should die instead of us.”Volkan died of a self-inflicted gunshot. Like all of the other men whose deaths were ruled suicide, he had worked on sensitive military defense projects for ASELSAN.Several other workers died under similarly mysterious circumstances, apparent suicides occuring without warning signs, coupled with sensitive work on secret defense projects.Turkish neuropsychologist Dr. Nevzat Tarhan reportedly was recruited to contribute to a Turkish Prime Ministry Inspection Board report. Tarhan, with special access to the details of the cases, came forward, announcing that some kind of psychokinesis, invasive control of their minds, had led to the workers’ deaths. He urged the Ankara Public Prosecutor to consider “telekinesis as a possible cause of the suicides, which could cause severe distress and headaches in the victims, giving them a tendency to kill themselves.” For researchers who believed in advanced deployment of psychokinesis, a related possibility was that unseen assailants had been able to mentally harm the victims’ bodies from afar, murdering them, or that they had used osteokinesis, the power to impact human bones, to control their movements.For what was likely the first time in history, a government report publicly alleged that psychokinetic weapons had been unleashed against its people.K\\nenji Ito, the young newlywed who had grown up in an era of covert unregulated experiments, continued to struggle in London. The voices “were constantly attached to me,” he insisted. “They were like a machine attached to me. When I’m conscious, this thing is attached to me all the time.”He shared the experience with a friend. To Ito’s surprise, his friend did not judge him. He mentioned a nearby doctor whom he’d heard was conducting mind control experiments in London. The doctor’s name was Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, a Cambridge-educated biochemist and author. For years, Sheldrake had been writing about — and allegedly, according to Ito’s contacts — carrying out experiments related to mind control.Ito’s marriage fell apart. He left London, and made his way back to Yokohama, where he worked a manual labor job. But his pain and fear did not subside. He continued to experience the voices that compelled him to do strange, “incomprehensible” things — and that threatened to kill him.He went online, and learned that Rupert Sheldrake was slated to give a keynote speech at the 10th International Conference on Science and Consciousness in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Ito knew what he had to do. He bought a plane ticket, and hoped to have answers soon.T\\nhe latest Romanian presidential election was another contentious one. Mircea Geoană was running against Traian Băsescu, who five years earlier had defeated Geoană to remain mayor of Bucharest. This time, the margin between the two was razor-thin, small enough to initiate a runoff election.The two men battled in a televised debate at Bucharest’s massive Palace of the Parliament. Geoană was feeling haggard and distracted. Băsescu won the debate and then the presidency.Afterward, Geoană knew who to blame: the mysterious man who walked into the debate hall with his opponent. The allegation was that the academic, Aliodor Manolea, initiated a “negative energy attack” on Geoană, causing him to falter on national television.During his presidential campaign, Traian Băsescu had taken to wearing a violet-colored tie or sweater, colors he didn’t usually wear. For those who believed in the power of flacăra violetă, or the “violet flame,” the color purple held unique psychokinetic power. The color was alleged to make “the wearer superior” and helped to deflect “evil attacks.”Geoană’s key campaign aide, Viorel Hrebenciuc, claimed that the psychokinetic plan began during the campaign itself, well before the December runoff debate. He had observed both Băsescu and members of his campaign sporting purple on pivotal days.Geoană’s claims of being unable to concentrate during their debates appeared within the bounds of Manolea’s purported abilities. He also seemed to channel the power of the violet flames, as several photos of him during the time of the campaign include him wearing a tie of that color.Sometime after Băsescu’s presidential election victory, he had a falling out with Manolea, who described Băsescu as a “man who does not love his people, his family or has no respect for his own culture.” In the wake of their disputes, Băsescu was embroiled in controversies, and the Romanian parliament voted to impeach him. Băsescu complained of “fatigue and headaches” during that time, leading his staff to insist that he was the target of psychokinetic sabotage.S\\ntakes were high for the 2008 International Science and Consciousness conference held in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the historic La Fonda on the Plaza. As Robert Jahn had reported at the PEAR labs, government analysts and bureaucrats had been surreptitiously monitoring and attending such gatherings. This ISC conference could be a turning point, achieving a critical mass among the advocates to turn the United States into a new sanctuary for psychokinesis research. Small strides were already visible. Leping Zha, who had been a psychokinesis test subject as a teenager in China, moved to the US, receiving an advanced degree before overseeing students in experiments he designed based on his own experiences.Government officials, professors, experimenters and former test subjects could walk the halls of La Fonda hotel together to begin what could be a new era.A featured event of the conference was Dr. Rupert Sheldrake’s talk on “Memory and Morphic Resonance.” Sheldrake, 66, was calm in demeanor and speech, but could deliver cutting criticism of mainstream science with a well-timed smirk. A biochemist with a Cambridge PhD, he had focused his research on consciousness, including how animals tapped into a part of their brains that seemed to send signals to each other.His concept of morphic fields echoed the foundational vision of Democritus. Sheldrake wrote of the “extended mind,” a notion of consciousness that transcended the physical body and instead “stretches” through “morphic fields,” which are “non-material regions of influence extending in space and continuing in time.”At two points during the conference, Kenji Ito attempted to sidebar with Sheldrake. Ito insisted the biochemist had supported experiments that had gone awry and that “people were using telepathy to speak to him.” The report stated that Sheldrake said he was unable to help Ito because he “didn’t have the resources available” that “he had at home in England.”Ito’s account differed. He claimed that Sheldrake had been dismissive of him: “I’m asking him how to stop telepathy… and he is laughing and kind of smiling like he looks at me stupid and then walks away.”Conference attendees noticed that Ito, agitated, sat in the front row of Sheldrake’s keynote speech. When the biochemist opened the floor for questions, Ito rushed to the podium. Hunting knife in hand, Ito lunged for Sheldrake, but tripped, and stabbed him in the left thigh.Sheldrake pulled the knife from his leg. “Every time my heart beat,” he recalled, “a fountain of blood spurted from the wound in my thigh about four inches into the air.” Confused attendees scrambled in the room; several managed to pin down Ito, who one witness said looked calm and distant like he was “in a trance.”M\\nomentum to rebuild psychokinesis studies ground to a halt. The combined aftermath of recent international chaos — the violent personal attack at the ISC conference, the political drama in Romania, the unexplained Turkish deaths — pushed the field back into the shadows.After it had seemed poised for breakthroughs, Princeton closed the PEAR lab in 2007. Robert Jahn had known his work and that of similar investigators would remain a source of contention for relentless critics like Professor Anderson. Jahn lamented that his project “was daunted by a recalcitrant university administration and a dearth of scholarly colleagues willing and competent to collaborate in such an enterprise.” Although he died in 2017, his partner Brenda Dunne continues to make the lab’s studies and papers available for further research. Other smaller endeavors also closed their doors, including the startup telekinesis lab in Florida.References in Congress’ proposed legislation H.R.2977 to psychokinetic weapons ended up removed without explanation. Eventually the bill was shelved.Some military scholars and historians who shared a school of thought with Commander Bremseth insisted that unpredictable psychokinetic battlefields had always been inevitable. The Marine Corps Gazette had noted that “fourth generation warfare” of the future will be “widely dispersed and largely undefined,” in which the human brain (according to another military report) would “be used to physically harm, sicken, or kill individuals,” unless checked by equivalent powers. These predictions held that the distinctions between war and peace would blur, as would distinctions between civilians and military. War could become constant and take place entirely via the mind, with the front lines formed by otherwise inconspicuous mindbenders and brainwave warriors scattered throughout ordinary society.Political decision makers may be far more attuned to such predictions than people imagined. Mircea Geoană, who documented his claims that his political opponent in Romania had been boosted by psychokinetic methods, now serves as NATO Deputy Secretary General.Science comes closer to Democritus’ theories as the brain’s capacity is mapped out. In India, a group of scientists used fusion imaging techniques (simultaneous fMRI, EEG, and magnetoencephalography) to chart brain activity related to psychokinetic activity, publishing findings in 2008 of “an association between telepathy and the right parahippocampal gyrus.” (This zeroed in on the same part of the brain associated with empathy and openness, also aligning with Democritus.) Daryl Bem, a professor emeritus at Cornell, in 2011 published what has been hailed as one of the first peer reviewed journal articles to lay out successful experiments showing precognition, the culmination of an eight year study involving more than 1,000 participants. In 2019, researchers at Caltech and the University of Tokyo teamed up to find the human brain could unconsciously detect changes in Earth-strength magnetic fields, demonstrating that brainwaves adjusted accordingly.In Russia, a 2017 military report prepared by the defense ministry became public that claimed soldiers were actively training in “psychic countermeasures” and “metacontact.” “With an effort of thought,” the report read, “you can shut down computer programs, burn crystals in generators, eavesdrop on conversation, or break television and radio programs and communications… They can see through the captured soldier: who this person is, their strong and weak sides, and whether they’re open to recruitment.”Other programs on psychokinesis remain shuttered. The personal effects on those who for many years were studied for signs of psychokinesis or who claimed to have been targets are difficult to quantify. Kenji Ito was sentenced to three years in prison. He apologized but never wavered from his original position. “I didn’t want to kill him at all. I felt I was being trapped into hurting him.” Ito insisted he stabbed Rupert Sheldrake to “try to find out who’s trying to control my mind.”Results of psychiatric assessment of Ito were muddied. One psychiatrist thought he had traits of schizophrenia, but pointed out that he did not have the usual “disorganized thinking.” Another psychiatric counselor rejected the assessment of schizophrenia altogether. Ito was found competent to stand trial and remained imprisoned in the US until 2011. Two years later, a man who ran a website about claims of mind control received a cryptic email from Ito, who said he was being detained in the Netherlands. Earlier, Ito had pleaded to return to Japan for a “brain scan.”In his court appearance, Sheldrake, Ito’s victim, told the court, “I investigate telepathy scientifically. I do not do it or control people’s minds.” Ito’s public defender noted that “for the first time ever in any courtroom in the world, somebody (Sheldrake) was qualified as an expert in the science behind telepathy.”Telepathy, in a way, had been certified by a court of law.The official retreat from psychokinetic studies repeated a long cycle. Plato reportedly feared Democritus’ ideas so much that he demanded that his writings be burned. (Democritus’ writings indeed ended up destroyed or lost.)In a major twist, Commander Bremseth has considered that the government’s ultimate purge of funding of telepathic techniques that occurred into the 2000s may not have been exactly what it appeared. It may have been a feint. He asked: “Did [the government] stage a ‘public execution’ as a means of taking the program underground?” In other words, governmental studies into psychokinesis may well remain active, out of sight.Off-the-books operatives didn’t have to start from scratch. They could co-op equipment and testing materials that had been gathering dust in storage, leftovers from government and private labs. They could tap into an invisible network of expertise spanning cultures, tracking down individuals trained by researchers–people like China’s Wang sisters, and the American boy who had shocked professors at 8 years old, and the indigenous Canadians who had shown anomalous abilities in their youth — a loose coalition of psychokinetic outcasts and exiles, by this point in their twenties to their forties, to be consulted, championed and mobilized.But most former students recruited and abandoned by institutes that experimented in psychokinesis remain untallied. Living in fear of being derided and rejected, the ex-students have few places to turn for answers. For his part, Aliodor Manolea, the Romanian political gatekeeper, now teaches at the Hyperion University of Bucharest, in addition to maintaining a private practice. He welcomes pupils to perfect techniques including “deep mind control.”AfterwordAs referenced in Mindbenders, Truly*Adventurous continues obtaining rare documents and declassified CIA files.

I switch to Slack hundreds of times per day (sometimes just for a second or two), send over 20,000 messages per year, am a member of 180 channels at work, and actively participate in 6 workspaces.Over the years, I have found a number of settings and features that have allowed me to stay on top of the firehose that it can be at times. None of my tips are specific to any one company and several people have found them useful so I figured it would be useful to share my personal Slack tips with the world.The very first setting I change in any Slack org is to only show unread channels and conversations. You can do so here. This is invaluable. Slack channels and DMs are often temporary and pile up over time. The transient nature of channels is a feature (see below). However, once old ones start piling up, it becomes untenable quickly.Slack allows you to group channels into sections. Think of them as folders for channels. Instead of one long list, you can arbitrarily group channels with a title + emoji.The most common way to use sections is by team/domain. However, I have found that making sections based on priority helps me stay on top of things much better. As I mentioned, I am in 180 channels in my work org alone. However, the degree to which I care about new messages varies greatly.My solution is to create four channel sections: tier 1, 2, 3, and rarely.When pinging somebody, never start with an open-ended “hello”. This website makes my point better than I could@channel will notify all members of the channel on desktop and mobile even if they are not working, sleeping, etc.@here will only notify people who are actively working.Both should be used with extreme caution. Think twice before using either. Is your message time-sensitive and relevant for everybody in the channel? If not, don’t use them.Slack outlines the differences here.This point is worth mentioning twice. Don’t overuse @here. Be respectful of people’s attention. If you wouldn’t stand in the middle of the office with a megaphone and announce your message to everybody, it’s probably not the right tool to use.Group DMs are useful for reducing clutter in public channels. However, the fun stops when you decide to loop in somebody new. Suddenly, you have a new group DM and that person can’t see what you were talking about before.Temporary channels also allow you to have multiple topical conversations with the same or a similar group of people at the same time.Finally, group DMs are a nightmare to find if you participate in multiple with similar groups of people. You have to remember the exact permutation of people in order to get back to it multiple days later.If you want to add somebody to a channel, add them directly instead of sending a message tagging them. There is no ready to mark the channel as unread for everybody just to add a new person.Channels should be public by default. Unless there is a very good explicit reason to make it private, make it public. It is good for culture and trust but also makes decisions and conversations searchable.Did you read a channel but aren’t in a headspace to respond? Option-click a message and Slack will move the unread marker to right above the message you clicked.Unread channels not doing it for you? You can have Slackbot remind you about a specific message at a specific time like this.Still not ready? You can snooze it again from the Slackbot reminder.In Slack, you can pin messages to keep them readily accessible to anybody in the channel. However, bookmarks are often more useful. Channels have a persistent bookmark bar at the top (once you have at least one) and let you pin any link, not just other messages.Press cmd+k or cmd+t to open the “jump to” window. You can type any channel, DM, or group DM from there.Press cmd+/ to see a list of all keyboard shortcuts. Find some that work well for you! They’re worth taking the time to learn.Did you send a message and immediately realize you made a typo? Press the up arrow and Slack will let you edit the most recent message you sent (even if it’s not the most recent message in the channel).If you type +: in a channel, Slack will pop up the emoji picker. Whatever you pick will be added as a reaction to the last message in the channel. Without the plus, it will send your emoji as its own message.I don’t use this feature very often but Slack allows you to cmd+click a channel to open it side-by-side with another channel.Slack Workflows can be used to create welcome messages when people join the channel.You can make your Slack workspace feel on brand or differentiated from your other workspaces by using themes. The theme settings provides a handy string that can be pasted into Slack and shared with coworkers which allows them to apply the same theme with one click.Love it or hate it, Slack is an integral tool at most companies. It can be a firehose at times but with a few tweaks, it can be extremely manageable. Hopefully, you learned a few new things.

The reignited pandemonium surrounding Jeffrey Dahmer is all thanks to the Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters-produced Netflix series, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Evan Peters is also the leading actor who depicted the pernicious Jeffrey Dahmer.Many viewers praised the portrayal, while some openly expressed their sexual attraction toward Evan Peters, playing a sadistic serial killer, as seen with a well-known TikTok influencer. Unfortunately, they\\'re not the only ones to have a disturbing, romanticized approach to viewing the series. People are utilizing their energy to create fan-cam videos of the series and the real Jeffrey Dahmer.The morality of true crime consumption and content creators who generate revenue from uploading true crime content is a discussion that\\'s now gaining steam. It\\'s not a new phenomenon where serial killer cultivates their freakish fanbase. Social media and modern technological advances allow information to travel faster and for people to encounter others with like-minded interests. Compounded with the now-mainstream true crime industry, consumers will enable themselves to be swept away by the morbid sensationalism of it all.With the new reignited interest in Jeffrey Dahmer previously mentioned, a wave of backlash came from family members of victims and concerned social media users. None of the families were compensated or even given notice about the released series. Rita Isbell, the sister of Errol Lindsey, publicly came forward to reveal that the series retraumatized her.Jeffrey Dahmer terrorized a community when he moved to a Black-enclave in Milwaukee. He was born into a respectable middle-class family. From a socioeconomic standpoint, he had the advantages and resources to ensure that he would obtain the expected lifestyle. His father, Lionel Dahmer, is a respected figure in academia. Outside, the family projected a scene from a Norman Rockwell painting.The emotional and physical neglect Jeffrey Dahmer experienced shaped his interpersonal relationships, absolved himself of personal responsibility and led to his eventual downward mobility. He was ultimately discarded from white respectability and found himself living on the fringes of society. This would become his hunting ground and killing fields.The social construct of white respectability played a vital role in how law enforcement and the judiciary system allowed Dahmer\\'s deviance and homicidal behavior to flourish. The media treated the Dahmer family with kid gloves because they were so well-spoken and unassuming. These perceptions helped establish a pseudo-narrative; Jeffrey Dahmer was a \"sensitive serial killer\" due to his childhood abandonment issues. Lionel Dahmer was the heartbroken father who did all he could.It\\'s time to closely examine the inner workings of the Dahmer family unit and how their social standing allowed them to dodge accountability for decades — even after Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s death. His childhood abandonment and familial estrangement as an adult were at the expense of a deeply marginalized community.Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s reign of terror took place during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Being Black, gay, or a part of a marginalized group was a bleak and suffocating experience—shrinking social programs and overall intolerance shaped life as a marginalized person throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.Milwaukee, during the 1980s and 1990s, had a problem with racism. Even in 2019, the city was ranked one of the worst places for Black people to live. One would imagine law enforcement and local government officials didn\\'t engage their Black or marginalized citizens with the respect a human being deserves. When Jeffrey Dahmer descended from his social/economic class, he found himself at the Oxford Apartments. He worked at a chocolate factory making $8.75-an-hour.Despite what the Black tenants of the Oxford Apartments experienced on a societal level, they still extended their kindness and sense of hospitality to their new white neighbor. The neighborhood was an underserved Black community with a high-crime rate.Jeffrey Dahmer became a familiar face in Milwaukee\\'s burgeoning gay nightlife. He sat at the bar and quietly observed people enjoying themselves. Growing up, Jeffrey Dahmer heard his father express disparaging sentiments about gay men and lesbians. Jeffrey Dahmer felt attracted to the same sex since adolescence but knew his father would disapprove. Lionel Dahmer is a Christian fundamentalist.Before Marsha P. Johnson threw the proverbial brick at Stonewall in 1969, Milwaukee had its uprising in 1961. Historically known as the Black Nite Brawl, this brave act of defiance to the anti-LGBTQ+ status quo ushered in a Gay Liberation Movement. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, former Milwaukee police chief, Harold Breier, mistreated the LGBTQ+ community and raided known gay establishments. Additionally, his policing tactics contributed to Milwaukee’s racial divide, ultimately setting an unspoken generational tone. When the first case of AIDS made it to Milwaukee in 1983, the LGBTQ+ community mobilized to take care of their own. Jeffrey Dahmer was the last thing this already vulnerable community needed.Lionel Dahmer pursued a college degree which kept him out of the home, and his mother battled mental illness. The same year Jeffrey Dahmer’s younger brother was born, his father became an analytical chemist. Most of the attention went to the newest edition of the Dahmer family. He witnessed verbal and physical altercations between his parents, which profoundly impacted him. Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s elementary school teacher detected signs of parental abandonment.Jeffrey Dahmer had a fascination with dead animals and kept their skeletal remains. At first, his father encouraged this, assuming he satisfied his scientific curiosity. During Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s adolescence, he decapitated a dog\\'s carcass and nailed it to a tree. He invited unsuspecting friends over to view his prank. Dahmer was the only one who found it amusing.By high school, Jeffrey Dahmer was a full-blown alcoholic. This was brought on by Lionel Dahmer\\'s physical absence and his mother\\'s tendency to self-medicate. His parents were aware of this, yet there were no efforts to get their son into substance abuse treatment. He was an outcast who didn\\'t take his education seriously. His father attempted to bring in tutors, but it was too late by that time.Once puberty hit, Jeffrey Dahmer knew he was attracted to the same sex. He felt ashamed of it. Growing up in a religious household and hearing a parent condemn same-sex relations didn\\'t allow him to talk openly about what he was feeling. Years later, in an interview, Lionel Dahmer professed if he found out about his son\\'s sexual orientation, he would\\'ve put him into conversion treatment. Sharing a forbidden kiss with a neighborhood boy began his descension into deviance. He had dark fantasies about domination and control.Around graduation from high school, his mother and younger brother moved out of the family home. The divorce of his parents was in the stages of finalization. Months before his mother and younger brother\\'s abrupt departure, his father moved into a motel. Jeffrey Dahmer seized the opportunity of having the home to himself and acted on his morbid fantasies by killing his first victim, Steven Hicks. In 1992, the mother of Steven Hicks sued Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s parents and stepmother. According to her, his parents should\\'ve known that he \"was deviant and destined to cause injury and death to others.″His father and new fiancée returned to the home a few weeks after the gruesome murder and discovered Jeffrey Dahmer alone. Lionel Dahmer embarked on a new life, and his son enrolled at Ohio State University. He flunked out after one academic term due to excessive alcohol consumption.For whatever reason, Lionel Dahmer didn\\'t sense an urgency that his son was in trouble or consider that his neglectful attitude exacerbated the problem. Instead, he talked his son into enlisting in the military, where he was discharged because of his alcoholism. While serving in the military, he drugged and sexually assaulted two people.Jeffrey Dahmer was back under the same roof as his father and stepmother. Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested two weeks after his arrival for being drunk and disorderly. No record of his father trying to get his son into treatment. Jeffrey Dahmer moved out to live with his grandmother. Lionel Dahmer felt his mother was the one who could change his son\\'s behavior. She was the only one to show her grandson affection.Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s upbringing contributed to his dysfunction as an adult. Throughout Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s life, his father fled parental obligations and dumped his son onto other people. There\\'s a pattern of Lionel Dahmer not living up to his responsibilities as a parent.Like all the other arrangements, living with his grandmother proved to be a failure. Lionel Dahmer also became aware of his son bringing men back to the house and exhibiting other disturbing behavior. Lionel Dahmer virtually left his elderly mother to deal with it.He was arrested twice for indecent exposure and later pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and using a child for immoral purposes. Additionally, Jeffrey Dahmer went undetected as he committed multiple murders in his grandmother\\'s home.Before Jeffrey Dahmer finished his year-long sentence at a work-release camp, Lionel Dahmer wrote a letter to the judge. He wanted his son to have court-ordered treatment. He knew the danger his son imposed on the public. Still, Lionel Dahmer didn\\'t feel inclined to take matters into his own hands to ensure his son received the overdue help. His son was eventually released early as a parolee.Jeffrey Dahmer moved into the Oxford Apartments in May of 1990. The property was well-maintained. The tenants were productive members of society. The neighborhood had a high crime rate, and everyone in the building looked out for one another. This is what enticed Pamela and Vernell Bass to move in. They would also become the neighbors of Jeffrey Dahmer.The married couple slowly built a rapport with their new neighbor who lived across the hall. Small conversations in the hallway led to drinking beer and smoking cigarettes in each other\\'s apartments. Jeffrey Dahmer even took a liking to their cat and offered to bring Pamela Bass a box of chocolates from his job.Vernell and Pamela Bass invited Dahmer over for Thanksgiving dinner. Incidentally, he would spend the day with his father and stepmother. On the day of Thanksgiving, Vernell Bass was able to get a formal introduction to Lionel and Shari Dahmer. Bass felt they were nice people. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel Dahmer unofficially dumped his deranged son on his doorstep.Other neighbors would describe Dahmer as a loner who kept to himself. Pamela Bass recalled oddities such as hearing him talking to himself and walking in the alleys late at night. Over time he neglected his hygiene and \"looked dirty.\" Vernell Bass heard sawing noises one night.Amidst the strange occurrences, Jeffrey Dahmer gave Pamela Bass a sandwich. To this day, the source of meat used for the sandwich is still a mystery. The tenants began to notice a smell that permeated throughout the building. Finally, Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s apartment was revealed to be the source of the horrible stench. He gave excuses that seemed plausible to the tenants.Throughout his tenancy at the Oxford Apartments, his parole officer, Donna Chester, never made the required twice-a-month home visits. Chester would later admit she didn\\'t make the visits because she felt uncomfortable going to a primarily Black neighborhood with a high crime rate. She kept a log to document the visits he made to her office. Chester described her client as a \"chronic complainer\" with suicidal ideations. Dahmer felt isolated from society and depressed. He referred to his father as controlling. There was an emphasis on his money troubles and coming to terms with his sexuality. After five years of not talking to his mother, he called her and revealed that he was gay. She was accepting of it.During their final meeting on July 18th, 1991, he disclosed he lost his job and faced eviction on August 1st, 1991. He was arrested for the murders he committed on July 22nd, 1991. Bear in mind he was murdering people as he visited Donna Chester\\'s office. Who knows what could\\'ve been if Chester had performed her obligations and visited Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s apartment? Her anti-Blackness cost people their lives. Luckily for Lionel Dahmer, his son was provided a place of residence courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. Jeffrey Dahmer was their problem now.The residents of the Oxford Apartments were devastated that a maniacal killer lived among them. They were able to carve out an ideal life for themselves, despite the locality being underserved and crime-ridden. For some time, the neighborhood experienced a series of break-ins. Residents of The Oxford Apartments rallied as they watched over each other\\'s apartments. If someone was in between paychecks, a person offered money to hold them over. Jeffrey Dahmer robbed them of a safe haven and breached their trust. He transformed his apartment into a murder factory. No one wanted to live in the building anymore.Both of Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s parents failed to uphold their responsibilities when it came to their son\\'s upbringing. There were so many indicators that their son was seriously troubled. Lionel Dahmer revealed to Stone Philips that he, too, had homicidal fantasies. He dealt with childhood bullying, and he would dream about murdering his tormentors. During the same interview, Jeffrey Dahmer’s mother claimed he was brought up in a loving environment, which we know was far from the truth.Pat Synder was a friend of Shari and Lionel Dahmer. She appeared on the Geraldo Rivera show and made accusations against them. Synder felt extreme guilt for what Jeffrey Dahmer did and wished she would\\'ve stopped it because she \"saw it coming.\" She described Shari Dahmer as a wicked stepmother. Additionally, she claimed that Shari Dahmer resented that her husband — Lionel — had to pay child and spousal support. It was also alleged that Jeffrey Dahmer once made a drunken admission that his father molested him.Unsuspecting victims and their families had to pay a devastating price for the dysfunction of the Dahmer family. Jeffrey Dahmer was neglected during his youth and became estranged from his parents as an adult. His deviant behavior manifested without interruption.The media depicted Lionel Dahmer as a sensible father who\\'s also a victim of his son. His father is neglectful and homophobic. Jeffrey Dahmer was known to use racial slurs. One of the witnesses who tried to save Konerak Sinthasomphone recalled that Jeffrey Dahmer referred to her as a “Black bitch” in front of police officers. If someone believed he learned racism from his parent(s), they wouldn’t be jumping to conclusions.Lionel Dahmer benefitted from being the father of a murderous son. He was featured on television and wrote a book — which will see an uptick in sales because of the Netflix series. During a side-by-side interview with his father, Jeffrey Dahmer boasted they were closer than ever. It\\'s infuriating his father wanted nothing to do with him until he was discovered to be a serial killer.The concept of abandonment was used to frame Jeffrey Dahmer\\'s murderous compulsion. He didn\\'t want companionship or something meaningful; he needed to satisfy his urges. The truth is he tried to control people to carry out his iniquity. He took what he wanted from whomever he could get it. The majority of his victims were gay men, and a few were heterosexual men. Jeffrey Dahmer had a dark soul and grappled with internalized homophobia.It\\'s time to bring the focus back on the lives Jeffrey Dahmer stole and the families he destroyed. Those who had the power to prevent the senseless murders at the hands of Jeffrey Dahmer turned a blind eye. Jeffrey Dahmer was banished to the margins of society when he failed to maintain his societal standing as a person of white respectability. How he conducted himself and who he harmed became the horrific reality of the unsuspecting marginalized people who crossed his path.'], ['Shifting Gears', 'Sara K.

The word chaldron existed before I made it up. A chaldron was an antiquated British term of measurement of dry volume, most often associated with a load of coal. Here is a photograph from Wikipedia of “a chaldron-wagon at Beamish”:If you were taking coals to Newcastle (but why would you want to do that?) you’d take them in chaldron-wagons, most likely.In the novel Chronic City chaldrons are mysterious and rare beacon-like, vase-shaped artworks that the characters bid to acquire on the internet. (Ebay, specifically.) The characters never win an auction, so they never get a chaldron shipped to their homes. Instead, they persist in their foolish belief that chaldrons are “real”.Later in the book, the characters are appalled to discover that chaldrons exist only as a virtual representations —propositional pixel emblems of the abstracted concept of ‘possession’. No physical chaldron ever existed, or can ever exist, to be possessed. That’s what makes them chaldrons.Chaldrons, in the novel, also operate as currency within a multi-player virtual reality game, and are produced by a form of “mining”.Few people troubled to notice that a fourteen year-old novel had predicted Non-Fungible Tokens — NFT artworks. And why should they? A million science-fiction-writer-monkeys at a million typewriters are liable to produce a few accidental predictions now and then. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and again; a stopped clock is right twice a day, etc. (Though a stopped-up toilet is never right, not once.)One odd thing about the internet, though, is that you can always locate the “few people”. Every viewpoint, every passing thought, has found a constituency. Here are a few examples from Twitter:I’m not an expert on NFTs, I should say. Let alone crypto-currency. The only thing I’m inclined to say about NFTs right now I already said better here, in a post I have pinned at the top of my profile:In other words, I hate them too. The problem is, I might also love them. In Chronic City, I sought to pin down that mysterious desire for the ineffable which paradoxically lurks inside our distrust of the virtual, the ideological, the figurative.(This might also have something with my lifelong enthrallment to Ubik.)Life is always interpenetrated by illusion, materiality always riddled with abstraction. Because we have consciousness, the first virtual reality machine.In a broken universe, we yearn to be consoled and sustained, not tricked. We want to be nourished by the steak, and denounce those who try to sell us the sizzle instead. Yet you can’t denounce sizzle; sizzle is bound to the steak, an integral function. And some version of steak is locked inside even the word “sizzle”, to such an extent that (if you like steak) your brain may now be conjuring an aroma as you read the word.And there are gargantuan industries devoted to supplying us with abstracted versions of material things like food, or natural environments, or other human bodies.The difficulty is making a home for the human within this perverse system.I’m engaged by the push-pull between the realm of the material and the abstractions of our various languages, including the digital. I once wrote a short story about a “blog” that was a physical artifact, a derelict construction rotting by the seaside. (Of course there are artists who’ve tried to do a similar thing — to implant the aesthetics and motifs of the internet back into tangible space.)And this morning what I hate about NFTs is not that they’re immaterial, per se, but that they’re cynically and unapologetically complicit in a Ponzi-scheme, fossil-fuel capitalism that destroys the planet. Also that they’re ugly.I would much sooner look at these, by Matthew Plummer-Fernandez:So, though my Ludditism is modulated by these tricky thoughts, I’ve spent most of my life on “team stuff”. Even as I work in the etheric realm of language, I pine for ways to embed it in materiality.I’m absurdly proud of my books as physical objects, as if they were individual paintings or sculptures I’d hand-crafted, rather than mass-produced (and, in the long run, largely disposable) vehicles for language-delivery.I love most of all when my words get stuck, like peanut butter piercing chocolate in the old Reese’s commercials that enchanted me as a child, in the ‘neighbor arts’.My favorite thing is songs and movies and paintings that make reference to my writing. It somehow seems to prove I exist, in a way nothing else could.The painter Tom Sanford made two phantasmagorical paintings based on Chronic City. If I could have afforded to buy them, I’d shamelessly hang them in my house.Tom did give me one of the studies for the main character of the book, Perkus Tooth. It is on a wall in my bathroom, acting as a kind of second mirror.Sometimes I can’t wait for the peanut butter of my writing to be engaged by the chocolate of an art or artifact, so I force the issue. Right after I wrote about chaldrons in Chronic City I was invited to contribute an object to a series of objects called The Thing Quarterly. The Thing described itself as a “publication” — a series of (mostly) useless objects created by different artists and writers, which if you subscribed to it, would arrive in your house. Like a chaldron, if you could only win the Ebay auction!I opted to design a pair of glasses. I’d always been fascinated, as a glasses-wearer, by the fact that we walk around with tiny pieces of text hidden along the insides of the earpieces, so near to our brains and our eyes. Because most eyeglasses-earpieces have words discreetly printed on them. Shouldn’t those words be important, or at least interesting? I decided my glasses-frames would be for people who wanted to see chaldrons, and be assisted in telling “real” chaldrons from fake ones.Around the same time, I get a chance to collaborate with the artist Matthew Ritchie. He’d begun a series of drawings called “Haruspex”, and he asked a group of authors to provide a text describing an “impossible object”. Well, that was a cinch. Most of these statements were extracted directly from the novel:And here is Matthew’s “Haruspex V”, which I prefer believing is a portrait of a chaldron:When I wrote a piece for the photographer David Maisel, he was kind enough to allow me to pick out two pieces in exchange. Each of these is a chaldron too, for me:The Charles Long sculptures littering my home are plainly attempts to render chaldrons.And Perry Hoberman’s Guston-esque white-ink doodle, hanging in my kitchen, is surely a depiction of someone hypnotized by a chaldron.My life, it turns out, is chaldron-blessed.

Over the past 12 months, there has been over $6.5 billion of ETI capital invested into Web3, which is more than double that of the next highest category of fintech at $2.7 billion.Even with all the ongoing challenges across cryptocurrency, which has seen its combined market capitalization decline by 2/3 since last November, investment interest in the sector remains stronger than other industries. Why? Because entrepreneurs still want to start Web3 companies.Building a good Web3 startup is hard. Explaining what makes a startup Web3 in the first place is even harder. Here are a few attempts. Leading Web3 investor A16Z describes Web3 as “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens”. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3, describes it as “an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are purely algorithmic things hosted by everybody”. Web3 has also been called “the hyperfinancialization of all human existence” and where “every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity”. Pretty confusing right?Here’s a simpler definition: a Web3 startup interacts with data stored on a blockchain. That’s it. Read from Ethereum via an RPC provider? You’re a Web3 company. Send a transaction on the Solana network? Web3. Implement a Connect Wallet button on your website? Same. Blockchains, the public shared ledgers of information, are the data building blocks of Web3, and if you use any of this data in your product, then you’re part of Web3 too.Now why is this interesting to entrepreneurs? Because we haven’t had free access to data in a long time.All consumer products need data. If you’re building a restaurant discovery website, you need reviews. If you’re building a shopping app, you need a product catalog. If you’re building a photo or music or video sharing service, you need (obviously) photos or music or videos. Sure you can get users to create that data for you — after all, users authoring data is the core tenet of Web2. But it takes a lot of users to create a useful amount of data, and until then the product experience for those few initial users will be incomplete or simply bad, which is then an impediment to acquiring more users. So you’re stuck in not a vicious cycle, but a stagnant cycle.For entrepreneurs from a decade plus ago, data used to be readily available online. You could crawl it (ex. Airbnb crawling apartment listings from Craigslist), or subscribe to it via RSS feeds that publishers were widely distributing. Platforms like Facebook and Google were also generous with their data providing robust API access (remember all the social games that used Facebook’s Graph API?). There was once even an entire category of products called mashups predicated around this idea of shared data that was composable.Unfortunately for entrepreneurs today, data is no longer easily accessible. RSS has been largely abandoned, most sites prohibit crawling and will sue to prevent it, and platform APIs from Facebook and others have either been shut down entirely or severely limited. More than ever, the web is a collection of walled data gardens controlled by a handful of gatekeepers and for good reason: the data and the infrastructure running that data is incredibly valuable. Gartner last year reported that 80% of the global cloud infrastructure market is controlled by just 5 companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei. It’s no coincidence that these are 5 of the most valuable technology companies in the world.The “haves” (companies with data) generally no longer want to share with the “have nots” (startups), which is why Web3 has become so attractive to entrepreneurs: you get to build with data in Web3. With blockchains, data is freely available to everyone. There are no gatekeepers to blockchain data because ownership is decentralized across tens of thousands of individuals or entities running their own shared copies of the data. You can spin up your own Ethereum node in a matter of minutes and download the entire blockchain onto about 1TB of storage. That would fit on many laptops so there’s not a lot of expensive infrastructure you need either.Because of blockchain ledgers, data access in Web3 is equal. Every startup has access to the same tokens, wallet addresses, transaction history, etc. and can build as complete a customer experience as any other company. We’re all “haves” in Web3, but is what we have useful? In other words, Web3 startups can now build new products that are filled from day one with all of this public blockchain data. But does this public blockchain data help make products that customers actually want to use?There has been one dominant customer value proposition for all Web3 startups this year. One powerful use case that all of their Web3 products — from games to art to fitness tracking — have been helping customers with: making money. During the last crypto bull market, every Web3 product became a speculative asset, and making money became the only scenario Web3 companies had to think about. When your product promises to generate positive returns for customers, it doesn’t have to promise much else.Take for example NFTs, which rocketed in popularity this year with millions of people owning them. In the bull market, NFT startups focused all their energy on helping those million users make money because the primary use case for NFTs was financial speculation. In their pursuit of driving up the price, most NFT product innovation centered around building reward systems for holding onto NFTs (i.e. staking) as well as creating walled gardens around NFT ownership (i.e. token gated content). But those features came at the expense of investments into arguably more interesting product explorations like being able to do things with NFTs and have them interact with other projects.Remember, NFTs are stored on blockchains where the data is freely accessible by anyone. Therefore, Web3 entrepreneurs should be building all sorts of novel, interoperable experiences with NFTs, just like Web2 entrepreneurs did with mashups. But because everyone was so obsessed with just the floor price, NFT projects built entire products designed to keep people from doing anything with their NFTs or having them interact with any other project. The pursuit of financial speculation above all else took data that was inherently open and made it closed.But now we’re in a downmarket where returns are negative. Web3 products can no longer rely on just the use case of making people money, and have to provide other value to earn the time and patronage of customers. We’re going to see a lot of entrepreneurial time and energy shift from innovating on financial speculation to pursuing new ideas for what you can do with data stored on shared ledgers besides making money. Will customers find these new scenarios valuable? Will products filled with public blockchain data be useful?Who knows for sure. But because entrepreneurs still want to build Web3 startups and investors want to fund these companies, we’re about to find out.'], ['How to Create Mattering at Work', 'Zach Mercurio, PhD', 'Nov 16', 'https://zachmercurio.medium.com/how-to-create-mattering-at-work-bef6b78fbe40?source=home---------15------------------0----------', 'Last month, the U.S. Surgeon General named “mattering at work” a top priority for improving mental health. The announcement reaffirms what we’ve known for many years: Mattering and well-being are inseparable, especially where humans spend 35% of their waking lives.The official call to prioritize mattering at work is the culmination of several conspiring forces reshaping what work means to and in our lives.Survey research shows that the pandemic prompted people to reflect more on the quality of their jobs and their lives. Data from the past two years indicate that people left their jobs not for more pay, benefits, or flexibility but largely because of disrespectful cultures, non-inclusive climates, and uncaring leaders.People deemed “essential” workers are now asking, “Do I feel essential?” We’re experiencing compounding health and job insecurity. The unemployed are returning to work, with studies showing that feelings of worthlessness constitute a significant risk factor for those transitioning from joblessness. Feelings of being forgotten and loneliness are at an all-time high amidst rising calls for social justice and inclusion.Upheaval events amplify people’s search for meaning, and we’re seeing a grasp for significance and demand for dignity in work. Creating mattering is a necessary answer.Mattering is the belief that we’re significant to the world around us. Psychologists and sociologists find that mattering arises from two primary experiences: 1. Feeling valued by those around us, and 2. Adding value to those around us.Mattering isn’t the same as self-esteem. Self-esteem is confidence in our worth and abilities. Self-esteem is one internal outcome of experiencing mattering to others. Mattering isn’t interchangeable with “belonging” either. When we feel like we belong, we feel welcomed, accepted, and approved by a group. When we feel like we matter, we feel significant to members of that group — we feel seen, important, and needed through how others treat us. A sense of belonging increases the chance we experience mattering and vice versa.When people do feel valued and know how they add value in life and work, decades of studies show they’re less likely to experience unhealthy stress, anxiety, and severe depression and much more likely to experience increased self-esteem, motivation, and overall well-being.In contrast, the perpetual belief that one doesn’t, can’t, and won’t matter is a hallmark of low self-esteem, disengagement in life and work, withdrawal, and clinical depression. One study of 1,026 Tennessee residents found that feeling insignificant predicted objective stress indicators like higher cortisol levels and blood pressure.The need to create mattering at work is not a new well-being trend or “touchy-feely” idea. Creating mattering is about as “touchy-feely” as feeding someone who’s hungry. When we create mattering for others, we meet a basic human need and fulfill a primal survival instinct.Mattering comes first. When we’re born, our survival depends on whether we matter to others. As a newborn, one of your first reflexes was to lift your head and scan the room to search for someone to care for you. You then reached out to grasp that caretaker. We need the care of others, and our primal need for attachment doesn’t go away as we move into and through adulthood.The survival instinct for attachment grows into the social need to be noticed and included by others. Psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary label the desire for caring interpersonal relationships a “fundamental human motivation.”New York University philosopher and Humanities Medal recipient Rebecca Newberger Goldstein goes further and deems mattering a core instinct that drives all human behavior. “Our mattering instinct is inseparable from pursuing a coherent human life,” she said in a recent interview.That’s why, when someone doesn’t believe they matter at work, it’s easy for nothing to matter. People won’t share their voice if they don’t believe their voice is significant. People won’t use their strengths if they don’t believe they have strengths. People won’t contribute if they don’t believe they have something to contribute. People won’t care until they feel cared for.Mattering comes first and filling people’s need for significance must be a core practice for redeeming work and revitalizing our organizations and society.There are three primary drivers of mattering at work: 1. Feeling Noticed, 2. Feeling Affirmed, and 3. Feeling Needed.Noticing others is the deliberate act of seeing someone’s uniqueness, paying attention to the ebbs and flows of their lives, and taking action to show them you see them.Noticing someone isn’t the same as “knowing” someone. You can know your best friend but not notice that they’re struggling. You can know a team member but not notice that their parent is in the hospital or that they’ve been struggling with a project.Feeling seen is necessary for mattering, yet it’s often overlooked. Global surveys find close to 43% of employees feel “invisible.” When it comes to taking an interest in others, it seems common sense isn’t common practice.Here are several practices and skills to ensure people feel noticed:Real affirmation is showing people how their unique strengths make a unique impact. In workplaces, meaningful gratitude and affirmation are infrequent, and most workers report feeling perpetually underappreciated and undervalued.Affirmation is more than an awards ceremony, simple acknowledgment, or a pay raise. Real affirmation is creating an environment that regularly provides people the evidence of their significance.Here are some essential practices to affirm others:Human beings are at their best when they’re needed. In our research, when we ask people to describe the moments of mattering in their lives, we often hear people talk about becoming a caretaker, a parent, or being called on to assume responsibility for someone else. It’s no different in work; when people feel irreplaceable, they act irreplaceable. They show up. They commit.On the flip side, when people feel replaceable, they act replaceable. They won’t show up. They won’t commit. Ensuring people feel indispensable and needed is key to creating mattering.Here’s how to show people how they’re needed:Try it right now. Think about the people you need. Take a moment today to tell them, “if it wasn’t for you…” and watch what happens.You’ll see and experience what the research indicates: Few things are more powerful than when a human being realizes they matter.Zach Mercurio, Ph.D., is a purposeful leadership, mattering, meaningful work, and positive organizations researcher, consultant, and author of “The Invisible Leader: Transform Your Life, Work, and Organization with the Power of Authentic Purpose.”'], ['How My Dream of Becoming a Novelist Led Me Astray', 'Jacqueline Dooley', 'Oct 25', 'https://jacquelinedooley.medium.com/how-my-fantasy-of-becoming-a-novelist-lead-me-astray-1dfb0bebc31d?source=home---------86------------------0----------', 'I\\nonce mailed a 600 page manuscript directly to Tor Books.

One where we are constantly confused by how metrics are defined, bicker over how to interpret various analyses, and struggle to apply the insights into action.It’s because building a data-informed culture is hard. Logging user actions, creating dashboards, running A/B tests, and shipping ML models — these are useful. But they are not the foundation of being data-informed.We believe that being data-informed comes down to internalizing a set of values. These are simple, few, yet exceedingly powerful:The first step to being data-informed is understanding what data can’t do: give you a purpose.Data does not substitute for a mission or a strategy. It cannot uncover a set of values. Metrics are merely proxies for what matters. “Increasing Metric X” is not a purpose; a true purpose must relate in some way to creating value for other humans. If a data-informed team feels at any point like they are optimizing metrics in a way that compromises their mission, they scrap that work.Before you can collect data to help you track what matters, you need to define what actually matters. Information itself is not an evaluation criteria.How will you know if you are fulfilling your mission? You imagine outcomes that build towards the future you envision. Then you set goals to help you verify whether you are achieving those outcomes.Vague goals that are difficult to verify aren’t useful and create confusion within a team. We want to make our users happier. We want to make the world safer. We want people to be more productive. These don’t give you an objective baseline to evaluate different strategies or tactics. And you won’t know whether you’ve achieved them.Data-informed teams push for quantitative goals to the greatest extent possible because they’re the best way for a team to focus on creating impact. They make progress transparent, force accountability, and rally your team around a shared outcome.Goal-setting is more art than science. All metrics are proxies and every set of verifiable goals will have shortcomings in what they fail to capture. As you learn those shortcomings, you will iteratively refine your methods of measurement and your targets. Setting goals is a skill — you have to practice it to get better.Data-informed teams adopt verifiable goals to drive impact while acknowledging these imperfections. They recognize that goals serve the team in their march toward the mission, never the other way around.Everyone has to know the numbers. You cannot outsource a data-informed culture.You can have the best team of analysts — but if you don’t know the numbers, then your decision-making will suffer.Data-informed teams regularly meet to review key metrics. Why? Decisions are never made in these meetings, so why have them at all?These meetings signal something important about the culture — that simply knowing and talking about the key metrics matters. Doing so builds a shared foundation among a team of what is going well or not well, and how they might best prioritize efforts.Good data-informed teams develop leaders who can weave data into clear narratives. These teams cultivate a skilled understanding of which data patterns are important and which ones are not. They point out conflicts in data and which interpretation is more likely. Most importantly, they are upfront about what the data can and cannot say.We all have hypotheses about what our customers care about, what products will win, and what decisions are best. The more experienced we become, the more we trust — and even pride ourselves on — our intuition.A well-honed intuition about which path to take is supremely valuable because we don’t have infinite time and resources to try every path.The danger comes when your pride in your intuition leads you to close yourself off to evidence that you might be wrong. Instead of testing your intuition with data, you seek out data that confirms your intuition.Openness to being proven wrong is insufficient. Data-informed teams actively seek out information that might disconfirm their assumptions. They value a high velocity of experimentation and setting hold-outs. Like scientists, they are constantly looking to test their hypotheses and validate their beliefs. They don’t view intuition versus data as a forced choice — they use data to refine their intuition over time.Members of data-informed teams regularly ask each other: “What evidence would convince you that your intuition is wrong?” If the honest answer is “No piece of data would convince me,” then you have strayed off of the data-informed path.Data will never give you certainty. Interpreting data means taking on many assumptions that are reasonable but not bulletproof. Even trusting a single piece of analysis means having faith that the events were logged correctly, that the metrics have been calculated without error, that everyone understands exactly what was logged and calculated, and that the interpretation is sound. You want to be 100% sure? Good luck.People who are not truth-seekers constantly take advantage of this. The easiest way to discredit data is to demand perfection from it.When data and intuition collide, some people always pick their intuition. They would rather be wrong betting on their intuition than wrong betting on data (this is rampant in the world of sports). That is a defeatist mindset. Your commitment to your mission requires that you make good decisions fast. Sometimes you will trust the data and you will be wrong. But if using data increases the likelihood of making the right call by 5–10%, those benefits will quickly compound.This is the promise of data — to help us gain an edge in our quest to build wonderful things for other humans.We are committed to promoting data-informed values, beliefs, and practices, and are looking for like-minded people interested in sharing their input on how to best tell this story.Drop us a note to join our community at datainformed@sundial.so.This piece was co-authored by Stanley Watt, Ani Prabhu, and Prasad Chakka.'], ['Famous Works of Literature, by Autocorrect, Part 2', 'Elizabeth Lee', 'Sep 8', 'https://thebelladonnacomedy.com/famous-works-of-literature-by-autocorrect-part-2-a5e0d55c8654?source=home---------293------------------0----------', 'Co-written by Summerlin WebbGullible Travels\\nLocals take advantage of a drunk, shipwrecked sailor to convince him he’s found a land of tiny people and talking horses.Lord of the Files\\nAnarchy ensues when Jack updates Ralph’s spreadsheet software.

Here’s the thing. Understanding your own bias is hard. All we know for sure is that, whatever it is, we probably don’t know what it is. Some kind of you can’t see it ’til you see it — it being your blindspot, standing cold and naked, exactly where everyone else can see it—sits comfortably on your shoulder as you move from design decision to design decision. So you try like hell to be thoughtful—or at least, obnoxiously thorough—and prepare yourself for an awakening all the same.It makes being in the position of choosing how we represent people kinda intimidating.Like, real talk, so intimidating that our first illustration style did not include people at all. Telling a story through objects sitting right there, being all Haaay. what if you just.. didn’t? and we were like oh yes. It’s just safer. And easier. There’s no lizard brain telling you that something is off about the elbow that is making it just kind of making it creepy. And no one notices if you re-used the same flower pot in every illustration (and, like, if you did: that’s on you for being weirdly observant, not on me for being efficient AF). There is no emotion linked to my drawing of a mailbox. There is no implied preference because I drew more dogs than cats. Safe. Straight forward. Matter-of-fact communication.The flip side, of course, is that when you add a person to that mailbox, the story is so much richer. Who doesn’t love getting mail ‽ (Not email, real mail. Duh). I can tell endless stories that people universally connect with if you give me a person and a mailbox. I can tell a memorable story, that you relate to, that says there are real, empathetic humans on the other side of this product, with a person and a mailbox. The problem is that I can kinda accidentally tell a terrible story with a person and a mailbox, too. Like, check: you relate to it; check: it’s memorable; super-did-not-mean-it check: it actually feels like the personification of the stomach knot that anxiety built when you see a full mailbox because that’s where taxes, bills, and collections notices come from. You were never going to do that with just a straight up mailbox. It’s just a freakin’ mailbox (and the award for most times using the word mailbox in opening paragraph goes to..). With a richer story, comes a greater risk of alienating or frustrating your users. With a richer story comes more responsibility to be empathetic and thoughtful, and a greater responsibility as a representative of the brand. Where previously each individual illustration stood alone, as a part of the UI, they are now connected through memorable characters. First it was a person at a mailbox; now they’re at their desk; now they’re buying ice cream—now you’ve got a narrative. People notice people. They notice what you decide to include, and what you don’t. However you decide to illustrate people, they quickly become both a representative of your organization, and a reflection of how your organization sees you.So we tread lightly. We try to set ourselves up to be inclusive as hell, and assume our crappy bias and stupid habits are going to creep in anyway. Kind of like my new years resolution. Like, yes, I can be trusted to pick out lunch that, in theory, will make my heart not explode, most of the time. But if you really want to stop eating blocks of cheese for dinner, it really helps if you sent yourself through the produce aisle ahead of time. Pick out the right ingredients while you’ve got time to be thoughtful, and there’s only so much damage you can do at 2 am with some kale and a box of clementines. Your unconscious is still going to find a way to hit every Fresh Slice on the way home from time to time, and oh boy we’ll look back and see some things we would have done differently. But we knew it was coming. Some lessons were learned. Adjust the shopping list and move forward. The first thing we took off the shelf on the Shopify illustration was unrealistic skin tones. Although we tested a whole range of different skin tones, including realistic ones, the unrealistic skin tones consistently stood out as something we wanted to work with. They were unique, they were memorable, and they were inclusive. Or, at least, they were never specifically, exclusive, I think. One less thing to think about. We can’t exclude anyone if we’ve kinda included no one, right?And, ya know, redesigns are bananas, and time is a limited resource. All things considered, I think we did a decent job trying to make our illustrations as diverse as possible. We made them different shapes and sizes; men, women and as much LBGQT as we could imply with, you know, a blob and no face. Some were disabled, some from different cultures, old, young, and all the in between ages too, I suppose. If nothing else, it was conscious effort to make sure that everyone was represented, and I think that much is reflected in the work.But as we continue to evolve, and iterate on our principles and approaches to the Shopify illustration style: I’d like to do better. I’m certain this isn’t all the ways we could do better, and I hope it’s not all the ways we will do better, but for now, here’s a how we’re approaching diversity as we move forward at Shopify.So, like, actually. We kept drawing people with dark skin and they just looked like white people with purple skin. I don’t know what that says about us— hopefully just that drawing is hard; maybe something about the demographics of Canada; definitely something about the demographics of our team.We quickly learned: if you want to be inclusive, you need to illustrate different people, not different attributes. Instead of trying to imagine the average person, and then plug in the various attributes—which, uh, inevitably somehow start to look like us—we set out to illustrate every person. Or, rather, any person, so long as they were specific and complete. Instead of a page of average + different size; average + different skin tone; average + different age…you get the idea—our illustrations finally felt like just a page full of people. Ultimately, hopefully, a better reflection what it means to be a Shopify user: someone who doesn’t necessary relate to the average, but rather a someone who feels unique, connected to a diverse community of unique people.When you look for an entire person to base your illustration on, the details work together to create someone we know and recognize. If we’re talking product design, we call that a win because faster recognition, in any capacity, lightens the cognitive load and helps you get your job done faster. If we’re talking user experience, we call it a win because it’s easier to talk to people if they see themselves reflected back in the product. If we’re talking inclusion, we just call it a straight up win. We updated our illustration style to feel more grounded in realism, and increased the level of detail to accommodate this shift in approach. Where each illustration previously could be an under-represented group, now they are.You know what just always goes over unreasonably well? Eames chairs. And pour over coffee. And really big desks with nothing on them. Which is cool, because who doesn’t want immediate and unwavering praise and approval. Bonus: you get to draw all your favourite things again.Which, makes sense, because it’s designers making things for designers. And literally no one else.Like, oh yeah? You just started a business and you thought a few 4000$ chairs were a good investment. Sure. Your desk is probably spotless too? Yeah, I hear that’s what entrepreneurship looks like: really tidy organized people with really clean desks and no stacks of paper or old coffee cups anywhere ever.Nah I mean as much as I want to draw another room of reclaimed wood and subway tiles, it’s not a thoughtful reflection of what our merchants day-to-day lives look like. By extension, it’s not an inclusive reflection of anyone, really. Our merchants aren’t running their business from the front room of a brightly lit coffee shop. They’re in the back room, with outgoing orders in one corner, a temporary day care in the other and if you’re lucky, just enough counter space to squeeze on a laptop.We came at it from a sincere desire to articulate our understanding and empathy to the challenges of modern entrepreneurship, and emerged with a an improved approach to inclusion. That thing where everyone has the same phone and the same laptop is.. not really a thing. I mean, yes, from where I’m sitting it feels that way. But from where I’m sitting everyone has the same haircut, outfit, and drink order too. Oh sorry is my bubble showing again? Not everyone has an iPhone. Acer is still a thing. Your daily latte is bougie as hell (okok my daily latte). Beginning each project by thinking about what obstacles someone might be facing, what resources they might not have access to, and how that might manifest in the physical world—objects; environment; uh, single concise word for, like, not everyone can just take a cab if they’re late, for example—is the difference between “our product is made for us”, and “our product is made for everyone”.It’s easy to draw the developer as a woman and pat yourself on the back see what we did there? women can computer too, you know. And, like, okay, so it’s the first thing we did too. We traded out every carpenter for a carpenteur and called it finished. And, actually, we’ll probably keep doing it too, so maybe I should just get off my high horse. But, it’s just that it’s a good place to start, not a good place to stop. You can’t just Freaky Friday your way to equal representation. To actively set denying antiquated gender roles as something that’s important to Shopify, and systematically remove them from our illustrations, we need to look deeper than job titles.Body language is a fundamental tool we use in our illustration style. We rely on it regularly to set the tone, join in celebration or direct your attention. It was quickly identified it as somewhere we could be cognizant of how we can deny traditional roles in favour of something more future facing and inclusive. When we’re illustrating something we often use a person to act as the verb in the illustration. If we need to communicate an action that has/is/will/needs to take place, we’ll use a single character in or directing motion; or two character interacting, to communicate the thing that needs to be done. Unchecked, this can become problematic, as gender bias begins to creep in. Cool you have equal representation in your illustrations, but who is always pointing to the white board?We by no means solved this, but for now, we started to identify some common places it is easy to fall into traditional gender roles.+ One character explaining something to another\\n+ One character giving an object to another\\n+ One character leading other characters\\n+ Conversation between characters (who is leaning in?)\\n+ Single character interacting with the viewer\\ndemanding (looking at the viewer) vs. offering (looking away from the viewer)It’s kind of weird to think about what the default is when we’re making illustrations. Like, duh, it’s a human doing the illustration, we don’t need to program their default settings, we can just talk to them, can’t we? But, like, it’s actually kind of wild the amount of work we put out the door. A lot of it is thoughtful and considered: the model citizen of any illustration project. And a lot of it: is just not. Just need something quick. This is launching basically yesterday. Can you just switch out this part? No I don’t have any more information for you. Realistically, we’re not as considered and thoughtful as we want to be on Every. Single. Project. Twenty quick wins later and omg did I just draw my friends again? As a content creator, if we internally shift our default approach to someone more under-represented, it’s one less calculation when everything is on fire, since you’ll probably be skipping that step anyway.I was surprised by how relieved I was to hear the simple advice “You too, white people. Don’t be afraid to mix it up and use images depicting non-white people.” Like, yes OBVIOUSLY I KNOW, but also ..thank you? Yes. Thank you for saying so, I think I needed to hear it. We illustrators are a timid creature, we really don’t like to offend. It’s easy to work yourself up; wonder if your attempt at inclusion feels forced or pander-y and fall back to whatever norms will go unnoticed. Drawing the culture you know always feels like the safer option on any single given project, often to the detriment of the overall body of work.Taking words like Mira’s We are DYING to see ourselves anywhere to heart, relieves some of that pressure to go unnoticed. It gives our illustrators permission to choose a dark hand or wheel chair for no other reason than they wanted to. Moving forward, we’re actively deciding over compensate and illustrate a higher ratio of under represented people. We’re aiming to be noticed. Because as much as Mira is dying to see herself, we’re dying to put her there.Diversity in tech is not going to be solved in an empty state. It’s still a relatively unchartered territory, where good intentions go kind-of-okay, and no intentions go catastrophically wrong. I don’t pretend to believe that if I just draw enough female CTO’s, the world will follow suit. And, honestly, it’s easy to look at the problems in tech that have roots so deep anyone would reasonably call them unsurmountable — and feel like our efforts as an illustration team are insignificant. Yeah I mean I can draw you whoever you want, but, like, your form only has two gender options.But illustration is where I built my house, and if nothing else, I’m gonna run my house like I’d run the world: made for everybody, and also probably a disproportionate number of tacos and dogs. Our approach to inclusion is something that I’d call perpetually incomplete, but hopefully trending in the right direction. We march gently forward—occasionally taking comfort in our insignificance; occasionally overwhelmed by it—as the purpose of our efforts becomes clear.Rather than feel the pressure to create change directly through each illustration, we aim to be an aspirational reflection of who we want to be. We use illustration to reflect the values we ultimately hold, even if we’re still waiting for the technology to catch up. It tells our users (and the world) that inclusion matters to us, and we are making a deliberate effort to normalize diverse representation in every day products. We use illustration to deliver the same message back to our own designers and engineers, reminding them that inclusion matters to Shopify, and they should take the same care in their own decisions. We don’t hold ourselves accountable to today, we’re aiming for tomorrows. We keep pace with Shopify, but constantly stay two steps ahead: as an evolving portrayal of what we believe in, and what we should collectively be aiming for.'], ['You Don’t Feel My Pain', 'Randy Fredlund', 'Sep 26', 'https://medium.com/the-haven/you-dont-feel-my-pain-e0a9ef7293ec?source=home---------222------------------0----------', 'You’ve arrived at the doctor’s office, and after adding to your pain by putting your phone away and reading through two magazines in which you have no interest, you’ve made it to an examination room. Someone other than the doctor has come to see you. Staring at the computer screen instead of looking compassionately into your eyes, the automaton asks, “What is your pain level?” The finger points to the chart on the wall.The chart is an attempt at quantifying one’s pain. In ten steps, Smiley goes from a cheerful upturned mouth to a deep frown, augmented by a tear. “Pick one.”This selection is a multi-level problem. Experience tells us that the intensity of pain does not match up well with this linear scale. Somewhere in between happy and awful is a point where intolerability factors in. While there are levels both before and after this point, that the point exists suggests an exponential scale.There is also a comparative problem. Since pain tolerance varies greatly from person to person, how does one know what to select so that the proper level is communicated? One does not want to be shortchanged in treatment because softies continually overstate their pain.Conjoined with personal tolerance is social judgement. Should one say just what level he or she (or whatever pronoun) is feeling, or will that result in an improper value judgement by the medical staff? If one selects number eight, will that be deemed something that only a wimp would admit to? And if one selects number two, will the resulting stare from the automaton say, “What are you doing here? We have other patients with real problems.”Submitted for your and Rod Serling’s approval, a scale with new and improved descriptions of the intensity of pain for each level, so others can feel your pain.0\\n“Right after you pass that doobie, you can go get us another beer. I’ll wait right here and sing along with the Dead.” OR “This ice cream is the best, isn’t it, Grandma?”1\\nYou are victimized by a surprise in-service training course with mandatory attendance. It is sprung upon you on a day when you almost called in sick. Now you are both annoyed and definitely sick.2\\nYou are itching from multiple bites by mosquitoes, augmented by the annoyance of killing one just as it lands. Your previously sucked blood splatters all over your arm. You shout, “You selfish vampire! One drink of my blood wasn’t enough?!”3\\nWalking barefoot through the house in semi-darkness, you slam your little toe into the leg of a recently moved table. The localized pain is intense, but not so great that you can’t stifle your scream so as not to wake others, even though your toe will never be the same.4\\nJerking your hand away from the suddenly bloody workpiece, you shout, “Who put the long nails in the nail gun?”5\\nHiking in the spring, you walk straight into a swarm of Adirondack black flies. Welts rise on your face and neck as you thrash in a violent futile effort to disperse them. Though you know the water will be cold, you contemplate diving into the nearest stream and staying completely under for at least 30 minutes.5\\n+5≠10 — An instructive example: You reach deep into the partially melted ice to search the bottom of the large and ancient metal cooler. The remaining bit of feeling in your frozen hand determines that the last beer is gone (any dedicated beer drinker will confirm that the absence of beer is at least a 5-level pain). As you turn your head and shout to your peers, “Hey, who took the last one?” the cooler lid dislodges and smashes your head into the latching mechanism (second 5-level pain). Painful, yes. 10-level, not even close.6\\nYou are jerked into wide-awakeness by cramping of your right leg adductors, the muscles that pull your leg toward your midline. As you quickly move out of bed to stretch and relieve the pain, the left leg adductors join the right in cramping. There is nothing that will relieve the pain on one side without exacerbating it on the other. The only solution is to attempt to relax while breathing heavily and waiting for the pain to subside. Crying is recommended. A kind spouse will bring you water without laughing.7\\nThe window sash you are working on becomes suddenly unstuck while 2 of your fingers are directly below, at the bottom inside the sill. It is an aged building, and the cords connecting the counterweights to the sash have long since disintegrated. Children are nearby. What words do you scream after your fingers stop the downward motion?7\\nand 1/2 — An electrical connection must be re-soldered while working in the cramped space under the dashboard of an antique car. The only position which allows you to both see the connection and the flow of solder puts your head directly under the workpiece. Just a tad too much solder melts to be absorbed by the connection, and a drip of molten metal disengages and plummets directly into your right nostril. Your convulsive reaction directs your head into the steering column, nearly knocking you unconscious. (A deduction of 3 pain levels if you succeed at blacking out.)8\\n(Male pain) The misguided soccer ball leaps off the insole of a forward with a cannon-foot and is blocked by your groin. The successive sensations of surprise, shock, and nausea overwhelm you. But they pass quickly as you fall to the ground, writhing as you wish you would pass out. The initial time-lapse can be the worst part for repeat victims who know what is coming.8\\nand 1/2 — One’s big toe has been afflicted by gout. This pain is so acute that sufferers seriously consider amputation in favor of recurrence. This level of pain dispels any misconceptions of how high one’s tolerance for pain may be.9\\nThe momentum imparted to you by a recently cut and moving tree trunk has propelled you off the roof. Fortunately, you were able to orient yourself for a feet-first landing. Unfortunately, the drop is more than 10 feet. Upon landing, pain travels up the back of the legs to the spine and terminates just below the (lack of) brains. A full-body functionality survey will be necessary but must wait for the intensity of excruciating sensations to subside.(Note that 10-level pain provides the benefit of indeterminate ending. While enduring 10-level pain, the sufferer’s misfortune is magnified by doubt that it will ever end.)10\\nThe screaming agony of passing a kidney stone - Most often experienced by males. As one sufferer says, “It’s pain that makes you sweat, pain that makes you puke, pain that makes the risk of a lifetime hooked on OxyContin seem like a small price to pay JUST TO MAKE IT STOP!”10\\nThe screaming agony of prolonged childbirth — — Most often experienced by females. As you do your damnedest to control breathing, you realize it is all a bunch of BS and scream, “GET THIS THING OUT OF ME!!!”So that men could understand, Moms Mabley once described the pain of childbirth in the following fashion. “I want you to put your hand on the back of your neck. Then push it up over the top of your head and down your face. Now grab your upper lip and pull it all the way back over your head to where your hand started. Doing that, Sir, will give you just a small idea of the pain of childbirth.”10\\n+++ Passing a kidney stone while giving birth.

For as long as I can remember, his name was a flash in the corner of my eye. When I was a child growing up in Iran, there were schools named after him. His face, cast in bronze, was prominently displayed in a museum in Tabriz, the city in which he died and was buried. His tomb is still there, pressed up against an overgrown apricot tree, in a long-abandoned cemetery. The edges of the sarcophagus are smooth and worn — not from the elements, but from a century or so of curious hands. People used to come here from all over the country to honor the American who gave his life for Iran. These days, hardly anyone comes at all. Those few who still visit his tomb know little about the man lying inside, save for the bare facts of his life and death.He was twenty-two years old, a Christian missionary. He came to Persia (modern day Iran) in the fall of 1907 to teach English and history and to preach the Gospel. He took up arms and fought alongside his students in a bloody revolution against a ruthless tyrant. He died a martyr in the cause of freedom and democracy.Howard Baskerville arrived in the northwest city of Tabriz in the fall of 1907. It was a politically turbulent time. In December of 1906, the Persian monarch, Muzaffar ad-Din Shah, signed a constitution establishing the rule of law and creating an independent parliament that would severely limit his unchecked powers. Three days later, he died in his bed. The throne was now in the hands of his petulant thirty-five year-old son, Muhammad Ali.Furious with his father for making what he viewed to be his God-given authority suddenly contingent upon the will of the people, Muhammad Ali Shah launched an all-out assault on the constitutionalists. He tore up the constitution his father had signed, declared martial law, and rolled canons to the threshold of parliament, destroying the building with the parliamentarians still inside. With the help of his Russian trained Cossack Brigade, the young shah violently reclaimed every city in Persia for the crown — every city, that is, except Tabriz.Baskerville had been serving as missionary in Tabriz for only short time when the shah’s troops arrived. But he had already immersed himself in the politics of the revolution. The soapbox preachers standing in the square extolling the masses to rise up against a godless tyrant. Farmers and factory workers willing to die for a constitution none of them knew how to read; the women dressed as men, and ready to die with them. Late-night political debates held in packed teahouses, bodies pressed against each other, the air thick with sweat and smoke and the subtle scent of rose water.Nevertheless, Baskerville had been repeatedly instructed by both the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions and the State Department not to engage in any activity outside of his responsibilities as a missionary and teacher. So that is what he did.Then the siege began.Unable defeat Tabriz militarily, the shah ordered his army to blockade it instead. If he couldn’t defeat the residents militarily, he would simply starve them into surrendering.What followed was months of unspeakable suffering. By the spring of 1909, there was no wheat or grain left anywhere in the city. The poor began to descend upon the orchards and meadows. They crawled on their hands and knees, chewing grass and weeds. They picked clover and alfalfa by the handful and stuffed them into the mouths of their starving children. A few enterprising residents had begun disassembling old shoes and unused saddles and boiling the leather in a pot until it was soft enough to chew. Others had been reduced to eating dung.“The sufferings of the town are increasing daily, and it is not doubted that a great tragedy is approaching,” read a report in the New York Times. “If Tabriz holds out, thousands must die of starvation, while if it falls probably tens of thousands will be massacred.”Witnessing the abject suffering of the people he had come to Persia to convert, being told that it was none of his business, that he was not to interfere with any “temporal matters” but keep his focus solely on the work of evangelization, became too much for Baskerville to bear. Standing in class one day, he confessed to his students that he could no longer bear to watch from a classroom window the starving inhabitants of the city who were dying for the same rights that he took for granted as an American. The best way he knew to help his students was to abandon his teaching post and go fight for them.The class was speechless. Incredibly, after Baskerville bid them goodbye and turned to leave, a number of his students rose from their seats and walked out with him. “We left the class pledging to follow our teacher who was ready to give his life for our country,” one of them recalled years later.When the American consul in Tabriz tried to dissuade Baskerville of his present course, reminding him that, as an American citizen, he was prohibited from taking part in a foreign war, Baskerville gestured to the mass of volunteers who had come to Tabriz from all over the world, ready to give their lives for the cause of freedom. “The only difference between me and these people is the place of my birth,” he said, “and that is not a big difference.”He then gave up his American privilege by handing over his passport. “I am Persia’s” he said.On the morning of April 20, before the sun rose, Baskerville and eleven of his students launched a daring assault on the western barricades of the shah’s forces. The battle did not last long. He and his students were quickly outgunned and outnumbered. While trying to divert the soldiers’ fire away from his students, Baskerville was struck by a bullet in the back.“I am shot,” he said, with a little laugh. Those were his final words.Meanwhile, the Russian and British delegations, horrified at the reports being sent from Tabriz, finally forced the shah to call for an immediate ceasefire in order to allow food and supplies to be sent to the population. The siege was over. But the revolution was not. With the fighting paused, the revolutionaries in Tabriz took the opportunity to regroup and march on Tehran. They removed Muhammad Ali Shah from his throne and reinstated the constitution. New elections for parliament were held in the fall; its first act was to officially recognize the young American missionary who gave his life to help free Persia from autocracy.Here we are now, a century removed from Baskerville’s death, and Iranians are still fighting for their basic rights. Indeed, beneath the widespread protests that have engulfed Iran over the last few weeks, is long-simmering frustration over the same issues that compelled Baskerville to join his Iranian students on the battlefield: that people should be masters of their own fate; that they should be free to act and think without coercion; that they should have a say in the decisions that rule their lives.I wrote this book because I believe every American and every Iranian should know the name Howard Baskerville, and that name should be a reminder of all the two peoples hold in common. My hope is that his heroic life and death can serve in both countries as the model for a future relationship — one based not on mutual animosity but on mutual respect.But his story is so much more than that. It is a powerful reflection on the universal ideals of democracy — and to what degree America, and Americans, are willing to support those ideals in a foreign, even non-European, land. It makes us think about what we owe to others around the world today.We may not be able to physically fight alongside Iran’s brave women and men, as Baskerville did a century ago. But we can still fight for their freedom.To read more about Howard Baskerville, you can order a copy of my book An American Martyr in Persia here.'], ['A Clash of Two Systems', 'Nassim Nicholas Taleb', 'Apr 19', 'https://medium.com/incerto/a-clash-of-two-systems-47009e9715e2?source=home---------108------------------0----------', '( This is a copyright compatible version of my side of a conversation with Laetitia Strauch-Bonart published in the French periodical l’Express.)This conflict shows a harmful confusion, among the Russians and their supporters, between the state as a nation in the ethnic sense and the state as an administrative entity.A state that wants to base its legitimacy on cultural unity must be small; it is otherwise doomed to meet the hostility of others. A Francophone Swiss citizen, although culturally linked to his or her language, does not aspire to belong to France, and France does not try to invade French-speaking Switzerland under this pretext. Further, national identities can change quickly: Francophone Belgians have a different identity from French people. France itself went through an operation of internal colonialism to destroy Provençal, Languedoc, Picard, Savoyard, Breton, and other cultures and eradicate their languages under a centralized identity. Nationality is never defined and never fixed; administration is.Cultural unity can make sense, but only in the form of something reduced such as a city-state –I would even go so far as to say that a state only works well in this way. In this case, nationalism is defensive — Catalan, Basque or Christian Lebanese — but in the case of a large state like Russia, nationalism becomes offensive. Notice that under the Pax Romana or the Pax Ottomana, there were no large states, but city-states gathered in an empire whose role was distant. But there is loose empire and rigid nation-state like empire, the latter being represented by Russia .There are now two imperial models: either a heavy model, like that of Russia, or a coordination of states on the model of NATO. We will see which one will emerge victorious from the current conflict. This war not only pits Ukraine and Russia against it, it is a confrontation between two systems, one modern, decentralized and multicephalous, the other archaic, centralized and autocephalous. Ukraine wants to belong to the liberal system: while being Slavic-speaking, like Poland, it wants to be part of the West.What we call “the West” is not a spiritual entity, but an administrative system first and last. Is is not an ethno-geographical ensemble, but a legal and institutional system: it includes Japan, S. Korea, and Taiwan. It mixes the thalassocratic Phoenician world of network-based trade and that of Adam Smith, based on individual rights and freedom to transact, under the constraint of social progress. In the United States, the difference between Democrats and Republicans is minor when seen from a different century. Both sides wants social progress, but at different rates of growth.On the other hand, nationalism requires the All-Mighty Centralized –worse, Hegelian — State, and one that curates cultural life to weed out individual variations.Nationalism is often linked to a spiritual dimension — represented in the Patriarch of Moscow via the Russian-Slavo-Orthodox model –which horriifies me as an Orthodox myself. Moreover, this alleged proximity between Ukraine and Russia is questionable: Crimea has been Russian since Catherine II, and Stalin has russified it by displacing the Tatars. It is easy to say that Ukraine is the soul of Russia because it comes from the Rus’ of Kiev, but it can just as well be said that it is the Golden Horde of the sons of Genghis Khan.And even if, spiritually, Ukraine were part of Russia, it would not mean that Ukrainians would not have the right to join the Western system. They could be emotionally Slavic but administratively organized in a Western system and militarily protected through an alliance between Westerners — which even includes, I remind you, Turkey. Putin cannot understand this, nor some specialists in international relations who are sometimes called “realists” — I am thinking, for example, of John Mearsheimer.These sloppy thinkers such as Mearsheimer and similar handwavers conflate states with individual interests; they believe that there is only a balance of power between powers — for Mearsheimer, Putin is only reacting to undue progress by the West on its ground. But the reality is quite different: what Ukrainians want is to be part of what I would call an international “benign” order, which works well because it is self-correcting, and where the balance of power can exist but remain harmless. Putin and the “realists” are the wrong century, they do not think in terms of systems or in terms of individuals. They suffer from what I call the “Westphalia Syndrome” — the reification of states as natural and fixed Platonic entities.Solzhenitsyn clearly saw the diabolical aspect of communist society, but believed that Western society was just as harmful. But being naturally multicentric, the West aims to be like Switzerland — it’s bottom-top oriented in spite of occasional concentration. Furthermore, the “West” is evolving; it does not have fixed centers of authority. Certainly, there are disproportionate influences in the West, as today’s Google and yesterday’s General Motors, but Google or General Motors are not the center of it — these multinationals do not even control themselves.Multinationals tend to go bust — in fact they are more likely to fold than your family run business.This model tends to “antifragility” — a concept present in my books that refers to a property of systems that strengthen when exposed to stressors, shocks or volatility. Russia cannot be what I call “antifragile”.A stable system requires a decentralized and multicephalous organization, which makes it possible to correct errors and avoid the deleterious effects of certain risks by confining them to the local level. After the 1918 war, the French destroyed Syria by centralizing it. Conversely, when the new Germany was formed, the French insisted that it be federal under the illusion that it would weaken it. Deprived of a center of gravity, Germany no longer thought of waging war, but of making… money. Butter, it turns out, works better than guns. Germany became an economic power thanks to federalism — and it appears to be natural as it spent its history in fragmented states before the Prussian takeover. For Russia, such a decentralized organization would be impossible: if let go of ballast, it would immediately find itself facing the secession of 20 small states — Chechnya, Ingushetia, Bashkiria… It therefore tightens the screw in the other direction.The interest of the Western world is that it is a multicephalous model, made of contracts that allows regional autonomy under global coordination; Russia is an autocephalous system, which thinks only in a balance of power. Look at the West: is there a center? No. If there were one, moreover, he would be in Kiev today. And if you want to destroy the West, how many bombs do you need? If you destroy Washington, London and Paris will remain. But if you destroy the palace where Putin is, it’s something else.The stability of a decentralized system is much better than that of a centralized system. As such, I am pleasantly surprised by the reaction of the Western world, which was done so, organically. I thought the West could not face Putin, because a fight between an autocrat and employees seemed lost to me in advance, but it seems that the aggregation of our actions is beginning to bear fruit.Subsidiarity was not respected, hence the departure of the United Kingdom. But the appropriate model is that of NATO, which exists in the area where organized joint action is necessary — military reaction — while letting countries do what they want under constraint not to attack each other. And I am grateful to the European Union for having succeeded in starting the concept of nation to think more in terms of regional coordination.Only if it fragments into separate states. Some Russian groups have always been irredentist, the Cossacks, the Kulaks (localist farmers), and the Siberians. There are also many minorities. More broadly, because of this Westphalia complex, it is forgotten that the Russians do not necessarily have the same interests as Russia. National interests are abstract things, and people end up believing in them even when they conflict with those of those populations they encompass.The Patriarch of Moscow was also Patriarch of Ukraine. But in the Orthodox world, whenever an ethnic or language division occurs, a “minor patriarch” is appointed in the country that has become independent — this is the case in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania. This is why the Patriarch of Constantinople, the most important, assented to the request that the Metropolitan of Kiev becomes a minor patriarch in 2019. Because of this separation, the Russian Orthodox Church felt amputated. The Patriarch of Moscow, Cyril, supports Putin. The Patriarch of Antioch, close to Assad, does the same.This also confirms, if it were still needed, the absurdity of Samuel Huntington’s ideas in The Clash of Civilizations. Not only is his book full of pseudo-mathematical reasoning (causing Serge Lang to blackball him at the Academy of Sciences), but, like other “realists”, his obstinacy to think in geopolitical and identity centers leads him to conclude that Ukraine belongs to the Russian domain. But one can be Orthodox in New York!It takes a while for a collective and distributed system to react. It takes a lot of sheep to fight a wolf, and in 2014 we were too few sheep.People want to be able to trade together in Adam Smith’s world. This false debate reminds me of the opposition between Napoleon and the English.All the English initially wanted was for their products to arrive safely. Napoleon’s views did not interest them. While Napoleon thought in terms of the glory of France, they thought of the wallet of the English shop owner. But the English grocer won and, with the Phoenician trader, it was he who made the modern world — the Anglo-Phoenician world of mercantile cosmopolitanism. This is what means, for example, that today Germans are more interested in exporting cars than in Germany’s geographic expansion.Moreover, it amuses me to hear some people talk about “American cultural imperialism”. Do you think that in the morning, when they wake up, Americans think about exporting their music and food? It’s simply that on the other side of the planet, young people prefer to eat hamburgers.The modern liberal system makes mistakes, yes. But when I criticize it, I don’t aim at destroy it, but at improving it. And it is a good system because it is self-correcting. I criticize naive Western interventions because I think about their consequences: I was against the war in Iraq, and experience justified my fears; I am against intervention in Syria, because if we get rid of Assad, we do not know what will replace him; I have nothing against Brexit, because if the British think they can manage to be part of our system without depending on the Brussels bureaucratic machinery, it is their right.The problem posed by a benign system like ours is its transparency, which causes perceptional distortions: Tocqueville understood that equality seems all the stronger when it is reduced; similarly, a system seems all the more dysfunctional when it is transparent. Hence my attacks on someone like Edward Snowden and his acolytes, who exploit this paradox to attack the West for the benefit of Russian plotters.I have trouble with many people, often naive libertarians, who think I’m like them because they like my books. But some of these want to destroy our system rather than improve it: many are full of resentment.This is the case of Snowden and his followers. He is an impostor. If I told you about an organization in Ryad that defends women in France against male oppression, you would laugh at me. Well, Snowden claims to defend the Americans against Google’s tyranny while operating from … Moscow!On Twitter, I ended up noticing that in this naive libertarian or rather, pseudo-libertarian, ecosystem, which includes bitcoin enthusiasts, people who, like Snowden, see Covid-19 as a pretext for some dark entity to exert control over the population. This even includes anti-vaccine activists. We are at the very heart of disinformation: the goal of the Russian Disinformation Program here is to create mistrust between citizens and authorities, and to exploit everything that can bring dissension. Disinformation proceeds according to Stalin’s assumed quote: “The death of a man is a tragedy. The death of a million men is a statistic.” These activists, for example, magnify tiny dysfunctions of the Covid-19 vaccines.I began to spot Twitter accounts called “Linda”, pro-Trump who, in protesting against inflation, used the sign of the ruble instead of the dollar. When the same people support both Canadian truck drivers and Vladimir Putin, there is a problem. In a way, I came to defend Ukraine because the same fools who attacked me on Covid also defended Putin.It is still disturbing that libertarians come to defend an autocrat!Libertarians are controlled by Russia because in general, they are naive people who only have first-order thoughts — they do not know how to consider the consequences of certain actions. This is what distinguishes them from classic liberals.We didn’t wait for this war to realize that Pinker was wrong about the decline of violence. There is no such a thing as Long Peace, largely because the past was not as violent as Pinker claims. My colleagues and I refuted Pinker’s calculations in our research. His errors come in particular from the fact that some data he uses overestimate the number of deaths in past conflicts. Pinker wants to play the guardian of modern liberal thought, but it is the American BHL: he knows nothing about his subject.Moreover, even if this conflict ends well, it will have shown that it is enough for a state to have nuclear weapons to cause a disaster. However, in today’s world, it is not acceptable for a leader to conquer another territory simply because he owns the atomic bomb. This principle must be destroyed.Which brings us to the next risk, China. Certainly, it has not escaped the modern world as much as Russia, and it is closely linked commercially to the West. But it also has imperial tendencies. The best thing would therefore be for it too to decentralize to escape the yoke of Beijing. Taiwan and Honk Kong outperform China, so consider more of those!If you give Putin even one finger, he will have won the war. Russia’s leadership must therefore be humiliated, and the only way is for it to retreat. We need a repetition of the 1905 Russo-Japanese war. In this case, Putin will be overthrown from the inside, because, historically, people who accept autocracies do not like the weak. A weak Putin is no longer Putin — just as a nice, tactful, and thoughtful Trump would no longer be Trump. For this to continue, it takes a lot of suckers to keep feeding the narrative — and if the suckers begin to doubt the story, it will be the beginning of the end.BACKGROUND'], ['Think introverted; act extroverted', 'Shaziya Tambawala', 'Sep 21', 'https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/think-introverted-act-extroverted-976e3164f3a0?source=home---------238------------------0----------', 'Picture this: you’re in one of those project kickoff meetings when everyone’s asked to introduce themselves, but you know, in a low-pressure, “say a fun fact about yourself” kind of way. Serving up a mildly interesting anecdote should be easy enough, but in this big group setting where your highly sociable coworkers introduce themselves with ease, you start feeling a bit anxious. The question, while intended to reveal commonalities, can feel like a measure of worthiness. Are you in the right room?I’m an introverted UX Designer at Atlassian and like most introverts, I recharge by spending time alone. Extroverts, on the other hand, gain energy by being social. I’m on a team of designers, engineers, product managers, and many more who design, build, and maintain our project collaboration tools. Sometimes, it feels like everyone around me is an extrovert. Yet when I confess to colleagues that I’m an introvert living in a seemingly extroverts world, many respond with knowing nods and “I feel the same way!”Many of the core job responsibilities in UX design are perceived to be more suited for extroverts. To do UX right, you have to get buy-in for your ideas from several stakeholders. With user research, you have to speak for hours to people who you don’t yet know and who will likely be struggling with your work. On paper, it seems like a job no introvert in their right mind would want. So how is it that so many UX designers and leaders identify as introverts?Let’s back up a bit. The terms introvert and extrovert (originally spelled extravert) were popularized by Carl Jung in the early 20th century to explain where we get our energy from. Unfortunately, their meanings got confused between then and now, and we started thinking that everyone belongs to one camp or the other.So really, if we looked at how most of us operated, we wouldn’t be on either end of the scale. We would be a mishmash of these personality types depending on the context.There are a few theories about the differences between introverts and extroverts, and some recent research has even shown that our genetic makeup has a lot to do with which tendencies are strongest in each of us.Shyness is fear of social judgment. The measure of introversion vs extraversion is about how one responds to stimulation, including social stimulation.Extroverts crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel ‘switched on’ and most capable when they are in quieter, more low-key environments. Again, these things are not absolute, but they are useful as high-level generalizations.An interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do because when they are managing proactive employees, they’re much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas. Whereas an extrovert manager can, quite unwittingly, get so excited putting their own stamp on things, that other people’s ideas don’t bubble up to the surface as easily.Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer while sitting alone in his cubicle at Hewlett-Packard. He says that he wouldn’t have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up.Now, of course, this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating — and case in point — Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer — but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.Atlassian is seemingly brimming with gregarious extroverts. And while I’m inspired by all these passionate, talented individuals, it can sometimes make this introvert feel like a grade A imposter. But as it turns out, there are a lot more of us in the field of UX Design than I thought.To understand the challenges that introverts have to face at the workplace,\\nRenato Galindo\\nand I spoke with designers** of varying backgrounds and experience levels. Their stories echoed some tactics that could be useful for introverted designers navigating their careers.Designers have the superpower to visualize people’s ideas. Sometimes these drawings can appear messy but the spoken word is often messier.It can often feel challenging and frustrating to explain design complexities but it’s a muscle that can be built with practice.This might sound bizarre and feel dishonest but it’s a tried and true tactic to approach the fear of presenting. Think about personas — you’re putting on that character and building more empathy for yourself.Keep small rituals that can help your creative juices flow.This one is primarily for those in management and leadership positions. Get your team to take personality tests and reflect on their communication styles.Clearly, the trope that extroverts are natural leaders and introverts are quiet followers just isn’t true. There’s more than one way to lead or contribute to a team — it’s all about finding what works for you.** Thank you\\nRobert Dietz\\n,\\nMichael Tinglin\\n,\\nJoel Unger\\n,\\nKseniia\\n,\\nKasturi\\n, and Erica for sharing your stories.What are your superpowers and struggles as an introverted designer?

I didn’t really invite you to look over my shoulder, but I didn’t mind it either. I was a nine-year-old starting a school newspaper with my friends. We would sell a paper for $2 a pop and be rich enough to feast on sausage rolls and meat pies from the tuckshop.You asked if I needed help, showed me some templates, and then just hung about, wiggling every now and then. I was glad for the company, being a writer can be a terrifying, lonely thing.I fell in love with Clippy (the artist formerly known as Clippit). As I would stare at the blinking cursor and start tapping away on the keyboard, there was a sigh from my soul when Clippy recognised what I was trying to do. Yes, I am writing a letter, how did you know? Yes! I am a writer of letters! My lunchtime labours of love in the library would slowly ripen with Clippy keeping me company.Clippy was the first computer software that recognised my intent and helped me, and I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.There were so many design patterns that came from Clippy, so many genius moves. Take the help out of the docs and into people’s hands when they need it. Create the first-time use. Show templates. Allow users to re-skin and customise their assistant. Throw a recognisable face on a tooltip.Let’s take one of these: I’ll expand on the genius move of putting a face onto a computer feature. The Stanford social psychologists that informed the decisions around Clippy recognised that humans respond to computers as if it was a human, so hey, let’s play with putting a face on a software tool. Babies prioritise faces when they are focusing their eyes for the first time and this continues as we age. Some smart people at University of Sydney coined this facial pareidolia. We’ll see a face in everything; a cloud, a rock crevice, a paper clip with stoner eyes.Society often makes fun of the person that comes up with a new theory. Aristarchus (It seems Aristarchus joined the first name club; like Lady Gaga and Cher) believed the sun was the centre of the solar system in 300BCE but was told that the maths don’t add up. Charles Darwin sat on his theory of natural selection for eight years because he knew that haters were gonna hate it. Ignaz Semmelweis was dismissed by the medical industry when he suggested the novel idea that doctors wash their hands in between handling cadavers and assisting women giving birth.Clippy was a new theory. It was the idea that a piece of computer software could be as useful as a human coach. The late 1990s was a time when 15% or less of households had a computer, software used to come with printed manuals and during usability testing of Microsoft Office, people were too scared to move the mouse.“What a lot of people don’t understand is, in the ’90s, the majority of people had not touched a computer,” says Karen Fries in an article by Seattle Met “They didn’t know how a menu worked.”Clippy was designed for first-time use and would interrupt you in order to be helpful, repeatedly.Honestly, we still haven’t nailed this human/computer interaction in 2022. I’m impressed by my interactions with Google Assistant and Siri, but still hit invisible walls in our conversations.Clippy was very gender-queer for 1997. You could change character, age, and species to a pup, Shakespeare, a red dot, Mother Earth, a cat, a wizard. There were elements of magic and delight that didn’t ladder up to an OKR that nevertheless got developed. It’s a playfulness that video games have cottoned onto but voice assistants long to replicate.It’s incredibly easy and lazy to hate on Clippy, in part because it was the first pass at “let me help you” that we all had shared access to. It came with Microsoft Office; we all had the same CD. It’s in the shared vernacular in a way that’s hard to replicate in 2022, where we have niches on niches on niches that mimic our own little bubble. Shared experiences are hard to come by (unless it’s a global pandemic).With Clippy we appreciated the help until it just lingered. In an article in Artsy, Clifford Nass, one of the Stanford psychologists, described why people started to turn on Clippy. “No matter how long users worked with Clippy, he never learned their names or preferences,” Nass wrote in The Man Who Lied to His Laptop, a 2010 book about human-computer relationships. “Indeed, Clippy made it clear he was not at all interested in getting to know them. If you think of Clippy as a person, of course he would evoke hatred and scorn.”Kevan J. Atteberry, the designer behind Clippy cops it on the chin like a champ on his website. Microsoft chose to ride the hate wave into a self-depreciating campaign that violently celebrated Clippy’s end of life.So here’s the thing: we may have fallen into group think and are dismissive about Clippy, but the impact and influence of Clippy is pervasive and powerful.Just like Clippy, “AI-driven” chatbots lurk in the bottom right-hand corner of every online shop — ready to shove a discount code in your hand or automate a return. Audrey Watters expands on Clippy’s influence in educational chatbots.Canva has been optimising the Microsoft Publisher suggestion and sensible defaults beyond what we thought was capable.The first time use of a new software can be an act of beauty, like how Squarespace helped users design their site.Last week, Apple released a feature called “Crash detection” that would detect if you were in a car accident and call emergency on your behalf. Complex, time-sensitive and life-saving stuff. You wanna know what content design pattern they borrowed from? Ol’ mate Clippy.Every time there is a marathon design-thinking session, where the tables are littered with post-its and the smell of sharpies and body odour are in the air, someone will inevitably say “The solution should be like Clippy, but better”.We’re still chasing the dream of being helpful, squeezing the most out of the software, and being so ‘seamless’ that no one notices we helped at all, and we should appreciate that Clippy was trying to do the same.The best experiences are the ones where the user feels understood and is gently given a platonic pat on the bum in the right direction.It doesn’t matter if your app is B2B, B2C or B2B2C. You are designing for humans.The most universal need as a human is to be recognised, to be seen, and to be helped along in our path. That’s all we want and when a software process manages to do that in some small way, it’s magical.Clippy, thank you for helping a nine-year-old write her first story in her school library. Thank you for living the dream, man even if you had early onset Alzheimers, we know your intentions were good. At the end of it all, you evoked a range of emotions from the tapestry of humanity when there’s so much software that emits nothing.As Neil Young wrote in a song:Rock and roll is here to stayIt’s better to burn out than to fade away.Long live Clippy’s presence and may it/they/he/she continue to inspire you.References:'], ['Avoiding the New Pig Butchering Scam on LinkedIn', 'DC Palter', 'Oct 25', 'https://dcpalter.medium.com/avoiding-the-new-pig-butchering-scam-on-linkedin-5a4bc6e586e2?source=home---------102------------------0----------', 'Recently, I’ve received a rash of connection requests on LinkedIn from attractive Chinese women.Because I’m an active angel investor, I get a lot of founders reaching out to me every day.

The odometer. The urinary catheter. The list goes on.But did you know he also invented…hustle porn?All the way back in the 18th century, he published his daily routine as part of his autobiography.No 6 AM Barry’s Bootcamp session or morning green juice, but it’s not so different from what you might find on “grindset” Twitter today.And when Franklin’s routine went viral recently, it begged some questions:Before we explore those big ideas, let’s first look at a day in the life of Benjamin Franklin.This is the routine he published in his autobiography:What stands out?If a founder or hustle guru posted the same list on Twitter or LinkedIn today, you’d never know this routine is almost 300 years old.But, for Franklin, sticking to his own script wasn’t always easy. He wrote:I love this quote. Because the gist of it is: “Routines might work for the common folk, but not me. My life is too busy and important.”We mythologize Franklin as an icon of American history, but despite including humility on his famous list of 13 virtues (notably last), he was well-known for his arrogance and even wrote about it himself:Is Franklin’s daily routine one of the first recorded examples of hustle porn? Maybe.Centuries later, an entire cottage industry exists to celebrate the routines of successful people.Stories like these are standard fare on sites like Insider and Fast Co. And since they keep getting written, people must be eating them up.Why are readers so drawn to them?But there’s another reason, too:These routines can be so unattainable, performative, and downright smug, it’s as if they were written just to annoy us. And to get mocked on social media.That’s exactly what happened when Mark Wahlberg’s routine went viral in 2018.2:30 AM wakeup call. 3:40 AM workout. 9:30 AM cryochamber.No one does this!And it’s not just celebrities valorizing their own impossible routines. On TikTok, the #morningroutine hashtag has 10 billion views and the #thatgirl hashtag — a trend celebrating the power of highly aesthetic (often unrealistic) daily routines — has 6 billion.While some people may love to hate the genre, many genuinely love it.Carl Cederström, a researcher at Stockholm University, attributes this cultural interest in routines to the capitalist glorification of individualism, which tells us to think of ourselves less as people, and more as never-ending projects. And this “wellness syndrome,” he says, can be dangerous:Fueled by social media that incetivizes “perfectionist presentation” — the manufactured performance of a “perfect” life online — this type of content can lock viewers into harmful, self-critical patterns.As author Will Storr writes:Yes. Routines can be healthy and empowering.But when they become about what everyone else is doing, “productivity dysmorphia” can set in.Just as the internet gavels productivity culture, it gave us the backlash against it.Detractors label it “hustle porn” — a fetishization of overwork at the expense of authentic fulfillment.A new category of anti-self-help books has even emerged rejecting the harms of productivity culture itself: Celeste Headlee’s Do Nothing: How to Break Away from Overworking, Overdoing, and Underliving, Anne Helen Petersen’s Can’t Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation, and Jenny O’Dell’s How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy, which made Obama’s favorite books list in 2019.The productivity genre commands a massive audience of fans. And now, a growing crowd of naysayers.But what is all the fuss actually about.Or put more simply: What is productivity?Economists define it as a measure of “output per unit of input.”Through this macroeconomic lens, productivity is essential to the common good.But personal productivity is something else entirely, and a relatively recent cultural phenomenon.As Deep Work author Cal Newport explains, as the American economy moved from fields and factories to offices in the last century, the burden of workplace productivity transferred quietly from organizations to individuals.This was followed by the rise of “knowledge work” — a workplace shift away from rote clerical jobs toward more creative, skilled ones that relied on the unique talents of the individual.In macroeconomic terms, there’s no limit to the productive output possible — at least theoretically. But for individuals, there’s only so much time in the day. In order to increase personal productivity, new tools are required to increase efficiency. Otherwise, the only option is to steal time from somewhere else — family, hobbies, etc.It’s this modern economic transformation that nurtured the conditions for productivity culture’s ascent in the cultural imagination.In a hypercompetitive, globalized economy that depends on the output of knowledge workers — one that incessantly demands better, faster, smarter, and more — it should come as no surprise that we’re in constant search of new solutions that will empower us to perform and produce more efficiently.And the market has responded to those needs with an entire industry dedicated to personal productivity. It’s given us new tools and technologies to help us self-optimize. And countless gurus selling false promises that exploit our intrinsic motivations to succeed. Buyer beware.It turns out that Franklin forgot something when he published his routine.In a separate letter to a friend, he wrote:Whatever works!For more insights like these, get the Knowable app and join 40,000+ founders, creators, and everyday go-getters building new skills and fueling their ambitions with audio lessons on business, startups, self-improvement, and more from the world’s smartest people.

For a summary and my response, see here.I ran Investor Relations at TimeWarner from 2008–2013, the period when Netflix emerged as a disruptive force in TV. In investor meetings, our CEO Jeff Bewkes was invariably asked about the threat Netflix posed to the TV ecosystem. He would often respond, sometimes in exasperation, “You can’t jam an $80 thing into an $8 thing!” His point was that Netflix, priced at $7.99 at the time, couldn’t replace the entire pay TV bundle because it could never absorb its costs.He was right, of course. A decade or so later, Netflix’s Premium tier costs $20 and it has not subsumed the entire pay TV bundle. But it fundamentally changed the economics of the TV business. Netflix was always willing to operate at much lower margins than traditional TV networks. Fearful of watching their traditional businesses eroded away, all of the major TV networks companies reluctantly followed Netflix into streaming. That meant they were constrained by Netflix’s price umbrella and beholden to its consumer value proposition and associated cost structure: massive investments in content, product, streaming infrastructure and analytics. They reasoned, correctly, that they had little choice; if they were inevitably going to be cannibalized, they better cannibalize themselves.In the last six months, however, the consequences of this transition have become clearer. Increasingly, it looks like Netflix’s cost structure — and therefore the cost structure of the entire streaming business — was predicated on a total addressable market (TAM) that was optimistically high and churn that was optimistically low. Changes in these assumptions will have a material adverse effect on the expected profitability of the business.I’ve written about these topics before, including One Clear Casualty of the Streaming Wars: Profit and Is Streaming a Good Business?. In this follow up, I address three questions: 1) is the slowdown in streaming subs a temporary lull (spoiler: probably not)?; 2) what are the financial implications?; and 3) if you’re a media conglomerate who’s been betting that streaming is a major growth and profit engine, what do you do now?Tl;dr:Over the last two quarters, growth in streaming subscribers has fallen markedly in the U.S. As everyone who follows the sector knows, Netflix lost subscribers in 1Q and 2Q 2022 in North America (Figure 1), raising the prospect that these markets (the U.S. and Canada) are now saturated. If there is any doubt that this is disappointing, keep in mind that for years Netflix has spoken of a U.S. TAM of “60–90 million” homes (for instance, here’s a reference from 1Q 2014). Netflix ended 2Q with about 73 million subscribers in “UCAN.” Assuming the U.S. represents ~90% of Netflix’s North American subs (pro rata with the U.S. and Canadian populations), that implies it is peaking at about 65 million subs in the U.S., the low end of the range.Figure 1. Netflix Subscribers Have Stalled Out in North AmericaSource: Company reports.According to Antenna Data, this slowdown is also playing out industry-wide, as gross adds fall and disconnects rise (Figure 2).Figure 2. The Slowdown is Occurring Across the IndustrySource: Antenna Data, Author estimates.A key question is whether the slowdown is a temporary lull or not. If it reflects a reversal of COVID-19-related pull through of demand, growth should rebound once it works through the system. If it reflects market maturation, then it won’t. The data strongly suggest it’s the latter.The growth in streaming subscriptions is a function of two things: growth in the number of homes that use streaming services (penetration) and the number of services per streaming home.As shown in Figure 3, the proportion of U.S. homes that use streaming is approaching saturation. According to Census Bureau data, at the end of last year roughly 94% of U.S. households had broadband service. Based on data from Parks Associates, 82% of them had at least one streaming subscription. How much higher this will go is not clear. As a reference point, pay TV peaked at 87% penetration of all TV households in 2011.Figure 3. U.S. Household Penetration of Broadband and Streaming are Reaching SaturationSource: U.S. Census, OECD, Parks Associates.The number of services per household also seems to be topping out. There are arguably eight “major” general entertainment streaming services: Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, the pending combination of HBO Max and discovery+, Peacock, Paramount+ and Apple TV+ (not to mention ESPN+). Is there room for all of these in the average streaming video household?Intuitively, the answer is no. Traditional pay TV has been overserving consumers for years. (To put it in the language of Clayton Christensen’s disruption theory, pay TV has been delivering consumers a product that is more than “good enough” — the very circumstance that makes an industry ripe for disruption.)From the 1980s through the early 2010s, cable programmers and distributors both benefitted from continually adding channels to the bundle. This justified annual price increases that outstripped the rate of inflation and, with few choices, consumers absorbed the higher prices. As shown in Figure 4, according to Nielsen data, the average number of networks available climbed steadily, even as the average number of channels watched did not. Every year, people were paying for more networks they didn’t use.Figure 4. Consumers Have Historically Paid for A Lot of TV Networks They Don’t WatchSource: NielsenStreaming offers consumers much more choice. The key question — which has loomed larger as more streaming options have come to market — is how will consumers react when they are empowered to better align consumption and expenditure? It looks like they are hitting the wall at around four services per home.As shown in Figure 5, based on a bottoms-up tally of all SVOD subscriptions and the estimated number of streaming homes (from Figure 3), at the end of last year, the average streaming household had about 3.7 services. Also note that the growth rate in services per home slowed significantly last year. After a surge of ~35% in 2020, likely spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the launch of several new services (Disney+ in 4Q 2019 and both HBO Max and Peacock in 2Q 2020), services per home grew about 9% in 2021.Figure 5. Post a Pandemic Surge, Growth in Services per Household is SlowingSource: Parks Associates, Author estimates.Reports of the death of TV advertising have proven premature. That’s good news for advertising, but also implies high consumer price sensitivity.For years, the growth of streaming was equated with the decline of TV advertising simply because there was much less advertising on streaming services. The largest SVOD providers, Netflix and Prime Video (currently) have no ads, and Hulu, the third largest player, carries a lower ad load than traditional TV (roughly 1/2 as many ad minutes per hour). It was assumed that people were adopting streaming in part because they hated ads. As more viewership steadily migrated over to ad-free or ad-light streaming TV, it seemed inevitable that “premium video” advertising (i.e., advertising in professionally produced linear and streaming TV) would decline.Ironically, it was Hulu’s decision to launch a premium-priced advertising-free tier in 2015 that would prove to be a turning point for streaming advertising. After launching the new tier, Hulu found that the majority of new subscribers still chose the ad-supported option and these subscribers’ satisfaction with the ad-supported service increased. It turns out that consumers don’t hate ads when the value exchange for watching them is explicit.Since then, there has been a resurgence of advertising on streaming. Today, there are numerous scaled FAST/AVOD services from which to choose (Pluto, Tubi, Roku Channel, Xumo, the Peacock free service) and most of the major SVOD services offer or plan a less expensive, ad-supported option. Discovery+, Hulu, HBO Max and Paramount+ all offer an ad-supported tier and Disney+ and Netflix both plan to launch ad-supported options. According to Magna Global, this year FAST and AVOD will generate close to $15B in advertising revenue (this excludes YouTube, TikTok, Twitch and other short form or user-generated video advertising).Based on Antenna data, for those services that offer an ad-supported tier, in 1Q 2022 about half of new signups took the tradeoff of a lower price in exchange for watching ads (Figure 6).Figure 6. Around Half of Consumers Opt for Ad-Supported Tiers When Given a ChoiceSource: Antenna DataThis is all good news for the broader advertising ecosystem. However, consumers’ willingness to trade off their time and attention for lower subscription fees also provides evidence of their rising price sensitivity as the number of services per home, and the monthly bill, rises.Relative to traditional pay TV, consumer switching costs for streaming are far lower, for two reasons: it’s possible to cancel with just a few clicks and the opportunity costs to cancel any individual service are lower when all networks aren’t bundled together.Churn for streaming services is surprisingly high, particularly for what could be called non-core services (i.e., not Netflix or Disney+), as shown in Figure 7. The inference is that consumers are keeping a few core services, but actively churning out the rest depending on what content is available. This behavioral change — toward active management of subscriptions — is another reason to believe that consumers are reaching their saturation point.Figure 7. Churn for “Non-Core” Streaming Services is Much HigherSource: Antenna Data.The key financial implication of this market maturation is that on current course, aggregate TV industry profits (by which I mean traditional TV plus streaming) probably peaked a few years ago. There are two reasons: 1) the growth in streaming revenue will probably only roughly offset the declines in traditional TV revenue, resulting in flattish overall revenues; and 2) even after the media conglomerates work through the current period of high startup investment, steady-state streaming margins are likely to be much lower than traditional TV. This prognosis is even more challenging for most of the media conglomerates. Other than Disney, none are likely to retain the same share of the streaming market that they have in traditional TV.As shown in Figure 8, I estimate that in 2021, the U.S. market for streaming was about $38 billion, compared to roughly $106 billion for traditional TV affiliate fees and advertising. (Note that the traditional TV figures reflect wholesale revenues that accrue to the TV networks, not retail fees paid by consumers to Comcast, DirecTV, etc.) The point is that, given the size differential, streaming must grow much faster to offset declines in linear TV revenue.Figure 8. Traditional TV Networks Revenue is About 3X StreamingNote: Advertising is national TV advertising, less syndication. Streaming advertising includes AVOD/FAST, but excludes short form (YouTube, TikTok, etc.). Source: Magna Global, Author estimates.The good, and somewhat surprising, news, is that traditional TV has continued to grow low single digits over the last few years despite the rise of streaming (Figure 9). That’s been driven by continued growth in affiliate revenue, as affiliate fee pricing has offset pressure on both advertising revenue and pay TV subscribers.Figure 9. Linear TV Has Continued to Grow Despite Streaming Competition…Note: National TV Advertising excludes syndication. Source: Magna Global, Author estimates.Figure 10. …But That Seems Likely to EndNote: National TV Advertising excludes syndication. Source: Magna Global, Author estimates.As shown in Figure 10, however, I expect that period of growth to end. Considering likely recessionary pressures in 2023 and continued declines in linear TV delivery, I expect TV advertising declines to accelerate over the next several years. I also expect affiliate revenue to decline modestly over the period. As shown in Figure 11, based on MoffettNathanson data, even inclusive of virtual MVPDs, as of 2Q 2022 pay TV subscribers were declining at 6% annually and tracking to be down even more by yearend. The question is whether affiliate fee pricing will be enough to offset the unit declines. Probably not. Affiliate fee pricing is highly opaque, but anecdotally rates are growing about 5–6% per year. An important indicator is the buyers themselves. As shown in Figure 12, total video programming spending started to decline on a year-over-year basis for both Comcast and Charter in 4Q 2021, suggesting that affiliate fee increases are no longer sufficient to make up for the decline in subs.Figure 11. Pay TV Subs are Declining 5% Y/YSource: MoffettNathansonFigure 12. Declining Programming Costs for Comcast and Charter Foreshadow Declining Affiliate Revenue for Programmers*Normalized for sports programming rebates in 1Q-3Q 2020 due to COVID-related cancellations. Source: Company reports, Author estimates.Conversely, streaming should keep growing at a rapid clip. I estimate that streaming revenue will grow about 12% annually between 2021–2025. This estimate is driven by a few variables: I assume streaming households grow slightly faster than household formation (as penetration continues to climb slowly); services per streaming household grows mid single-digits each year (to reach about 4.5); service providers do not see much growth in effective subscription prices (as a mix shift toward lower-priced advertising supported tiers offset price increases); and streaming advertising grows mid-teens.Overshadowing the specific assumptions underlying these forecasts, however, is the simple math: as mentioned before, given the relative sizes of the traditional pay TV and streaming revenue pools, streaming has to grow almost 3X as fast as pay TV declines for aggregate TV revenues to stay flat. As shown in Figure 13, I expect that will be the outcome: total TV revenues remain relatively stagnant over the next few years as growth in streaming offsets pay TV revenue declines.Figure 13. Aggregate TV Industry Revenues Will Likely Stay About FlatNote: National TV Advertising excludes syndication. Streaming advertising includes AVOD/FAST, but excludes short form (YouTube, TikTok, etc.). Source: Magna Global, Author estimates.All of the media conglomerates are currently incurring heavy investment spending to support their streaming businesses. But even once they work through this period, steady-state streaming margins will likely be much lower than traditional TV.Figure 14: Historically, TV Networks Margins are in the Mid-High 30%-RangeNote: Disney is on a September fiscal year and Fox is on a June fiscal year. 2019 precedes push into streaming. Source: Company reports.I wrote about streaming margins in detail in a recent essay (Is Streaming a Good Business?), but here’s the basic idea. Historically, TV networks margins were 20–40%, among the highest in the broader economy (Figure 14). Streaming margins are unlikely to reach the low end of this range.It’s possible to see why by examining Netflix’s financials. Now that Netflix has stopped growing in North America, it is finally possible to determine with some degree of confidence the steady-state unit economics of a Netflix sub. Those economics are daunting for almost every other streamers. As shown in Figure 15, despite its massive scale, I estimate that Netflix spends about $10–11 in monthly operating costs per subscriber. Importantly, ~$5 of this is non-programming spending.Figure 15. Netflix Spends About $11 per Sub per Month in North AmericaSource: Company reports, Author estimates. Note: Reflects content amortization, not cash costs.As I explained in more detail in that essay, the media companies are likely incurring at least as large, if not larger, non-programming unit operating costs as Netflix. One reason is the higher churn mentioned above; for a given level of subscriber acquisition cost (SAC), higher churn means a shorter customer life and, therefore, a higher monthly amortization of SAC (or phrased differently, higher ongoing marketing costs). This implies that the media conglomerates are spending $6–8 monthly per subscriber even before any content costs. For many of them, that alone approaches or exceeds their ARPU (Figure 16). Assuming comparable spending on content as Netflix, on the current trajectory it will be hard for most of the media companies to turn a profit, even at scale.Figure 16. Most Streamers’ Costs > ARPUSource: Company reports, author estimates. Note: All as reported as of most recently-reported quarter, with the following exceptions: HBO Max from 1Q22 AT&T earnings report; Peacock based on commentary in Comcast 4Q21 earnings that service had 24.5MM monthly active accounts (MAA) and 9MM paying subs, with ARPU for paying subs “approaching $10” — as of 2Q22, it had 27MM MAA and 13MM paying subs; Discovery+ based on guidance last provided December 2020, assuming mix of 50/50 ad-free and ad-lite plans.So, on current course, the aggregate TV profit pool will likely be smaller in five years than it was a few years ago (before the current period of heavy investment spending). But not everyone will fare equally. As shown in Figure 17, Disney is the only conglomerate that is retaining share in the transition to streaming.Figure 17. Traditional and Streaming TV Revenue Share, 2021Note: Traditional revenue includes network affiliate and advertising revenue. Streaming includes SVOD and AVOD/FAST revenue, but excludes short form (YouTube, TikTok, etc.). Assumes no directly attributable revenue for Amazon Prime Video. Represents Fiscal 2021 for Disney (September FY) and Fox (June FY). Source: Company reports, Author estimates.Above, I used the phrase “on current course” a few times. How can the industry change course? Well, to state the obvious, it needs to raise revenue, lower costs, reduce churn, extend the tail on linear TV and figure out how to extract the most value possible from each content asset.In other words, it needs to shift its focus back to optimization and away from streaming subscriber growth. That has long been the essence of the entertainment business. This framing helps explain some of the recent industry news and predict what’s likely to happen next.Every business is a multivariate optimization problem. But media businesses inherently have more variables than most (Figure 18).Content is an information good, which means it has very high fixed costs and low marginal costs. Since pricing is therefore not constrained by marginal cost, it has wide pricing flexibility. Its value is primarily emotional, not functional, so there is a wide variation in consumer willingness-to-pay. Like other information goods, it is extremely flexible, in the sense that many price discrimination or “versioning” models are possible (bundled/unbundled; windowed/”day-and-date;” rent/sell; one-time transaction/ongoing subscription; ad-free/ad-supported/ad-light; full-featured/no frills, etc.). Successful IP is evergreen and extensible, creating opportunities for sequels, spinoffs and reboots and multi-channel, multi-modal exploitation (such as into other forms of media, games, merchandise or events). Many providers are vertically integrated and global, so they must choose whether to sell wholesale or D2C, whether to retain or license rights, which markets to enter, and so on. Digitization enhances all of these elements, enabling an almost infinite combination of price and features.Figure 18. The Media Business Has a Lot of LeversSource: AuthorThe history of the media business is about finding new ways to squeeze more value out of a given content asset. A good example is the windowing of a film. Traditionally, films cycled through several windows in the 8–10 years after premiering: theatrical, then home entertainment (rental and sell through), then premium TV (HBO, Netflix, Showtime, etc.), then free broadcast TV or basic cable networks, then back to premium TV, then finally bundled and licensed as “library” content to free TV, premium TV, SVOD or AVOD yet again. Each window offered consumers different tradeoffs, such as between time delay, rent or purchase, subscription or one-time, bundled or unbundled, uncensored or censored, paid or “free” (advertising-supported).In recent years, media companies have moved away from this practice of optimization as they prioritized the growth of their streaming services. To drive subscribers, they offered their streaming services at low prices (often, substantially lower than they generate in wholesale affiliate fees for the same content packaged into traditional linear networks); collapsed or shrunk theatrical windows; aggressively ramped up content spend; reallocated content budgets away from high-margin linear networks to low-margin streaming services; and curtailed or stopped licensing content to third-parties.With growing evidence that the streaming business will be neither as large nor as profitable as many hoped, the needle is swinging back. This is the point that WarnerBros Discovery (WBD) executive JB Perrette was making when he presented the slides below (Figure 19) on the company’s recent 2Q 2022 earnings webcast. Seduced by the promise of streaming, the industry had strayed from its roots. Now, it has no choice but to go back.Figure 19. Optimization vs Streaming Growth-at-all-CostsSource: WarnerBros. DiscoveryIn recent months, there have been numerous examples of this shift back to optimization and away from streaming subscriber growth-at-all-costs. Here’s a non-exhaustive list:I expect we’ll see a lot more of these kinds of announcements and speculation, categorized in four areas: monetization, retention, cost and portfolio. In addition to the examples above, here’s a quick sketch of what each may mean in practice.MonetizationAside from Netflix and Disney, it is a matter of debate to what degree the other streamers have much pricing power. But there are other ways to boost revenue besides price hikes:Acquisition and RetentionA slowdown in subscriber net additions will increase the importance of retaining existing subscribers and a more granular understanding of LTV/CAC (customer lifetime value/cost of subscriber acquisition). This will require service providers to better understand why subscribers initially join, why they churn and LTV/CAC within different acquisition channels. Are certain cohorts more likely to churn? Are there different churn profiles depending on acquisition channel? Do promotions work? Do fans of certain content genres have different propensities to churn? How does the scheduling of content affect churn? Depending on the answers to these kinds of questions, possible actions may include:Cost, Including Content OptimizationAny business reducing its growth forecasts will naturally turn its attention to its cost structure. Beyond typical “cost out” programs, we expect media companies to re-evaluate their largest discretionary expenditure: content. Not just tightening up content budgets or shifting toward lower-cost programming (e.g., more unscripted), but also approaching content optimization more analytically.Content optimization consists of determining the optimal window, channel and business model for each content asset along an array of parameters, such as subscriber acquisition and retention, aggregate revenue (including subscription, advertising, licensing, box office and adjacent revenue streams like merchandise) and production and marketing costs. That may mean repurposing streaming content on linear (as WBD is speculated to be considering). It may also mean less absolutism about third-party licensing. Until recently, if a big media company licensed content to a third party it was interpreted as a lack of confidence or commitment to their own streaming service. True content optimization will dictate that sometimes the profit-maximizing decision will be to license a given show or movie.It’s potentially a rich vein, but it will be hard to mine. Most media companies will need to invest in data management, analytics and business intelligence tools and the data scientists who will make this all work. Besides the heavy technical lift of aggregating data and making it accessible and useful to decision makers, media companies will need to change longstanding practices. Many media companies are organized in silos, each with its own GMs, development executives, budgets and financial targets. Different executives often run different cable networks; linear networks and streaming services may have different management; and movie studios are often run separately from TV. Objectively evaluating the best window or channel for a content asset will require both a holistic view across distribution outlets and the authority to decide.It will also require a much heavier reliance on data. Historically, most media companies were wholesalers, so they didn’t have much 1st party data, and many functional areas aren’t accustomed to using it. It also poses a cultural challenge. Hollywood is self-selecting for executives who have high regard for their own intuition. Many will resist the idea of augmenting that intuition with data.PortfolioAs mentioned above, over the last decade the TV business has transitioned from one of limited consumer choice to almost unlimited choice. This necessitates a change in strategy. When consumers had little choice but to take the pay TV bundle and distributors were willing to keep adding networks to the bundle, it made sense for media companies to keep launching new networks.Today, when consumers can choose which services they subscribe to, it makes sense to have the fewest number of high-quality, logically distinct networks/brands as possible. A streaming service has to have enough brand recognition and content heft that consumers consider it indispensable. Also, as the traditional pay TV business continues to decline in both subscriptions and viewership, many existing networks will become less viable. The logical outcome is that secondary and tertiary brands will be re-branded to create a more obvious linkage with the primary streaming brand, divested or even shut down.On WBD’s recent 2Q 2022 earnings call, management laid out its intention to prioritize profits over streaming sub growth. A lot of the subsequent commentary was critical, arguing that WBD was acting out of weakness, hampered by its debt load and HBO Max’s relatively sub-scale competitive position. In my opinion, however, it is not only the right strategy, it is the only viable one.TV is a textbook example of what Christensen called low-end disruption: an industry overserves its customers with a product that is more than “good enough” at too-high a price; a new entrant comes in with an “inferior” product that nevertheless attracts substantial demand; the new entrant systematically moves up-market to offer successively higher quality (first library content, then kids, then first run syndication and finally original TV and movies), siphoning off more demand in the process; and then the incumbents eventually succumb to the innovator’s dilemma, launching their own competing offerings and cannibalizing themselves.Like any other industry subject to low-end disruption, it has been inevitable for years that the profit pool of TV would decline. Now it’s becoming clear and the industry is adjusting accordingly. Optimization isn’t sexy; unlike blowing out sub estimates, the Street won’t pay for it until it shows up in the financials. It’s also not the most consumer-friendly approach. Content will be available in different places, in different windows, with different features and at different prices. But for an industry grappling with a structurally-smaller profit pool, it’s the only choice.'], ['Learning to Cope with Estrangement: When Children “Cancel” Their Parents', 'Ed Ergenzinger', 'Aug 21', 'https://medium.com/invisible-illness/learning-to-cope-with-estrangement-when-children-cancel-their-parents-914a4a80d2be?source=home---------1------------------0----------', 'Estrangement between parents and their adult children appears to be on the rise.

For years we gathered — uncles, aunts, cousins — at my grandmother’s small ranch home in Southern Georgia — with some of us supplementing the traditional dinner with a late night trip to Waffle House.Then in 2004, our family suffered two tremendous losses. First, my mother died in July — only 4 months after being diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer. Then, my grandmother died in November, following a short illness likely brought on by the death of her only daughter.That year we gathered at a funeral, not over turkey. And I wondered whether our tradition would continue, given the absence of the two women who had — like in most families — organized our family gatherings for decades.But my uncle — now the oldest living child — rose to the occasion. He set up a schedule in which each family would alternate hosting, with my brother and I stepping in for our mom. We’ve now continued that plan for the last 18 years (with a one year interruption in 2020 due to covid).Much will be written this week about the stress of Thanksgiving, from the difficulties of traffic jams and delayed flights to the challenges of cooking a turkey and pleasing picky eaters. But this week is a great time for us all to instead focus on what we’re grateful for in our lives — and empirical research reveals that doing so is good for our happiness and our health.Researchers in one simple study randomly assigned people to one of three groups:Before the study started, all participants had kept daily journals recording their moods, physical health, and general attitudes. The researchers could then compare how people in these different groups changed over time.Can you predict the findings? People who focused on what they were grateful for felt 25 percent happier — they were more optimistic about the future and they felt better about their lives. People in this group also reporting exercising more and had fewer symptoms of illness.Although this study was conducted with relatively young, healthy people, other research reveals very similar benefits for people struggling with serious challenges. People with neuromuscular disorders, which cause joint and muscle pain as well as muscle atrophy, who write about things they are grateful for in their daily lives show greater satisfaction and more optimism. Women with breast cancer who spend ten minutes a day writing about their gratitude toward someone in their life show better psychological well-being as well as better adaptation to cancer. These findings all tell us that focusing on what you are grateful for has real and substantial benefits, even among people struggling with serious, even life-threatening health conditions.This year it’s my turn to host the annual family gathering, and I’m feeling very grateful that our tradition has continued. My family includes a diverse range of people: meat-eaters and vegetarians, Southerners and Northerners, Republicans and Democrats. We share allegiances to different sports teams and almost definitely voted differently in this year’s midterm elections.But we’re family — and this year will add yet another set of Thanksgiving memories, from putting out a brush fire that nearly got dangerously out of control in my grandmother’s yard to canoeing on a river in Northern Florida to eating deep dish pizza in Chicago. And I’m grateful not only for another year of creating memories with aunts and uncles and cousins, but also for my wisdom in ordering the entire meal from Whole Foods.'], ['Is theoretical physics broken?

Therefore, when one associates the words artificial intelligence and art, one immediately thinks of DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and other algorithms. In this article, instead, I want to discuss why artworks are often less safe than we think, and how artificial intelligence can help preserve them.It is a mistake to think that cultural heritage is safe. Many of humanity’s most valuable works are also among the most fragile. Throughout history, only a fraction of works of art has managed to survive over time.For example, during wars, cultural heritage is often damaged. During antiquity, it was considered common practice to loot newly conquered territories, a tradition that was maintained during colonialism and Napoleonic plundering. In addition, during World War II a huge number of works of art were damaged or lost forever. Several works were stolen by the Nazis (and never found again), while others were destroyed during the Allied-led bombing raids on Germany.Even today, during the war in Syria, millennia-old cities such as Aleppo have been brutally destroyed (more than 70% of the city according to the UN). Not to mention the acts of terrorist groups that destroyed and looted Palmyra and Iraq’s museums (often many of these works were resold to buy weapons). In addition, dictatorial regimes have often destroyed important works of art even in recent times (Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban).In addition, many works were destroyed or damaged during natural events. Often events such as earthquakes or other natural disasters lead to the loss of valuable works. During the Florence Flood of November 4, 1966, thousands of precious and ancient manuscripts were covered with mud and heavily damaged (some are still being restored). Cimabue’s precious crucifix, a 14th-century work, was also affected by the flood and required delicate restoration. Even today, many areas are at risk of flooding, and the phenomenon of acqua alta (high water) is a risk to Venice.During the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon in 1755, a great many valuable ancient volumes kept in the Royal Library were lost (along with works by Titian, Rubens, Correggio, and Caravaggio). In addition, many works were lost in the fire of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734 (priceless works by Velazquez, Rubens, Bosch, Brueghel, Van Dyck, El Greco, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and many others). Even today, fires like the one at the National Museum of Brazil in 2018 or the one at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019 demonstrate how such destructive events can still happen.In addition, some natural phenomena that cause damage to artworks are caused by human activities. In fact, pollution and climate change put artistic and architectural heritage at risk. For example, acid rain is accelerating the erosion of the Egyptian Sphinx, but it is also a serious problem for marble buildings. Rising temperatures are thought to be catalyzing chemical reactions by increasing damage to historic buildings.There are also accidental events in which artwork was lost (airplane crashes and other forms of transportation). In 2006, a man fell after stepping on his loose shoelace at the Fitzwilliam Museum (Cambridge) destroying three 17th-century Chinese vases. While in 2010, a woman fell on a Picasso painting at the Metropolitan Museum damaging it (a painting valued at $130 million and considered one of his masterpieces). In 2000, a Sotheby’s employee disposed of a box using a crushing machine, only the box was not empty but contained a Lucian Freud painting.In addition, the neglect of artworks is also a serious problem. Frescoes, ancient paintings, statues, and monuments are fragile works, so maintenance and restoration are expensive and delicate operations. In 2012, the restoration of a painting by an amateur restorer in Spain caused a stir (but there are other examples such as the “potato head” of Palencia).In addition, we could also add neglect (such as the collapses caused in Pompeii), vandals and madmen (such as the man who damaged Michelangelo’s Pietà), art trafficking, economical interest (for example, when building dams), and other causes as well. That is why UNESCO, which reviewed the World Heritage Sites, also keeps a less prestigious list where the heritage sites that are at risk are included.The destruction of a work of art goes beyond the mere economic value of the work. When it was done intentionally in both ancient and modern times it was to erase the memory of a people (whether religious or cultural). In recent times, these same mechanisms have been used to destroy archaeological remains in Bosnia, Syria, and Afghanistan (considered contrary to religious doctrine). Moreover, the debate is more topical than ever as, for example, those who call for the return of goods stolen during colonialism (e.g., the famous Benin bronzes that represent the history of the nation and have been scattered in European museums) claim.As we have seen, heritage is at risk from natural phenomena but also from political choices when funds earmarked for preservation are cut. There is a civic duty in all of us in protecting what is our memory and this, in my opinion, also extends to data science. In fact, the use of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more democratized and can be used at less cost by anyone for social applications.In short, artistic works are fragile and often more at risk than people think. How can science and artificial intelligence protect them?To begin with, new scientific investigation techniques allow us to learn about the works. Even the greatest artists begin their works with a sketch and often rethink as they go. Today we have several techniques that allow us to analyze pictorial works (such as x-rays), which are not only noninvasive but allow us to tell the story of the work. However, these techniques produce data that are often difficult to interpret (especially with several overlapping images), so machine learning algorithms have been developed for image analysis.X-ray exposure is able to show underdrawings or changes in progress. For example, this showed that Rembrandt fine-tuned the composition of the figures in his masterpiece Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild several times. Leonardo da Vinci himself had drawn angels and other figures before painting The Virgin of the Rocks. Although it can sometimes be easy to be able to identify the artist’s various interventions, there were often several patterns that the artist repainted several times generating several overlapping images. These patterns are difficult to distinguish, and AI helps to be able to reconstruct the different phases of the work.Artificial intelligence has also proven to be useful in restoration. For example, it has been successfully used in digital restoration (photography, articles, and even manuscripts). The MACH laboratory in Cambridge has used AI algorithms to identify damage and virtually reconstruct the images in manuscripts (a process called inpainting). Similar technologies have been used to reconstruct damaged photographs, color black and white photographs, reconstruct the image of frescoes, and so on.As an interesting example, researchers recently reconstructed with AI and projected how Rembrandt’s masterpiece, The Night Watch, must have originally looked (the painting was arbitrarily shortened when it was moved to another site). Furthermore, such a technique can be used to reconstruct works considered lost: for example, two panels are missing from the famous Van Eyck brothers’ Ghent Altarpiece (1432) and researchers have used a convolutional neural network to try to faithfully reconstruct the two panels.The reconstruction of lost paintings is still a controversial application. Indeed, when an attempt was made to recreate lost Klimt paintings with AI (in 1945, three of Klimt’s masterpieces were irretrievably lost), researchers made it clear that the idea was not to replace but to give an idea of what is considered lost forever.Another intriguing use of artificial intelligence is the authentication of paintings by algorithms. Indeed, valuations of works are a huge market and often attributing works is not easy (especially if it is the work of a painter or someone in his workshop). Recently, a method has been proposed whereby by studying the topography of the work, the signature of an author can be reconstructed. In short, the surface height information is recorded (at 50 microns spatial resolution) and then passed through a convolutional neural network (CNN), so that differences in brush strokes can be studied.Similar methods could be very useful for avoiding counterfeits of works of art, even being useful for dating and attributing works. In addition, algorithms that can recognize the signature of work can be useful against artwork trafficking.Artificial intelligence and its applications will also have an impact on archaeology and archaeological heritage.Moreover, X-Ray is not restricted to paintings. In fact, researchers often also analyze objects such as glass (for example, to understand the workmanship), mummies, and statues. In addition, other techniques such as CT scans are also often used. The Antikythera mechanism (mysterious Greek artifact) itself has been analyzed by X-ray to study its possible operation. In all these cases AI algorithms applied to image analysis have proven to be very useful.Another interesting case is palimpsests: parchments or books that were erased by scraping off the ink and then rewritten again (parchment was expensive and was therefore reused by amanuensis monks). Today, erased text can be reconstructed using imaging techniques, allowing us to rediscover masterpieces of antiquity believed lost. Recently, using artificial intelligence and X-rays it has been possible to transcribe to decode the Archimedes Palimpsest (which contains two works of Archimedes thought to be lost).The terrible eruption of 79 AD covered the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with a deluge of ash and lapilli. Beneath this blanket was found a valuable library of papyri (papyri rarely survive the Mediterranean climate). Unfortunately, previous attempts to unroll and decipher them had led to the destruction of the papyri. Fortunately, new imaging techniques make it possible to analyze them without the need to unroll them.The X-ray approach had been successfully attempted with a 1,700-year-old Hebrew parchment found in En-Gedi, Israel. Unfortunately, while the Israeli scroll contained a metal-based ink that showed well on x-rays, the Hercolanus papyri were written with a carbon-based ink, meaning that “there is no obvious contrast between the writing and the papyrus in x-ray scans”. For this, the study authors used more energetic X-rays but also artificial intelligence. The authors used a 3D-convolutional neural network to detect the text and decipher it.Image analysis can also be used to discover unknown archaeological sites. The discovery of an archaeological site is often a fortuitous event (excavation for other reasons) or requires expensive investigation. Indeed, lidar technology (in which one targets an object or a surface with a laser), has been successfully used to detect new archaeological sites (in Mexico the remains of Angamuco were thus found). This technology has also been used to reveal anthropogenic changes to the Angkor landscape. Lidar, thermal images, and satellite images can therefore be analyzed with AI to monitor the status of archaeological sites and study interventions.In the past, these instruments were on helicopters or small planes. Today, however, drones are increasingly popular and allow greater flexibility. For example, one research project used drones to map the ruins of Pompeii. Mapping is the first step to verify which structures are at risk, follow the evolution of the site, and plan priorities for interventions. Furthermore, drones can also be used in difficult areas such as underwater archaeology.As we have seen AI can be used to reconstruct damaged paintings. The same approach can also be used for archaeological artifacts such as mosaics. Recently, a paper was published that presents an interesting approach. The authors tested the “outpainting” capability of OpenAI’s DALL-E (the AI takes as input an incomplete image and fills in the missing parts). They tested them either with mosaics that were already damaged (both figurative and geometrically patterned) or by artificially removing parts of well-preserved mosaics, so they could compare the results.The approach and results are intriguing; it also takes advantage of an existing algorithm by trying it out under different conditions. This demonstrates the flexibility and emergent properties of these algorithms. On the other hand, as the authors note, the results are not always exciting:Artificial intelligence can also be used to catalog and automate tedious tasks. Archaeologists find thousands of fragments of pottery (especially Roman) and it is tedious work to analyze thousands of fragments of vases, amphorae, and plates. On the other hand, all these fragments once cataloged and studied the relationships between them, can provide valuable information on the daily life of past civilizations. In Cambridge, they have developed an algorithm that matches the fragment with the pottery profile in a database. This approach makes it possible to quickly catalog, and then with other algorithms study, the distribution of the various types of ceramics in an archaeological site.This approach is not limited to Roman ceramics. Researchers at the University of Arizona have used a similar approach to classify the designs and patterns of ancient Pueblo ceramics.Archaeologists often find epigraphs, but these inscriptions are often damaged over the centuries and rendered illegible. Recently, DeepMind presented Ithaca (a follow-up of the previous model called Pythia), an artificial intelligence model capable of finding missing characters in a text that has been damaged. The authors of DeepMind trained their model on one of the largest corpora of Greek inscriptions to obtain results similar to those obtained by human epigraphers. Similar approaches have also been attempted with other languages such as the Scythian language, 3000-year-old Chinese oracle bone scripts, and Persian cuneiform tablets.Although it is not easy to decipher ancient inscriptions when the language is known (Greek, Latin, and so on), there are cases when the language is lost. Languages can be grouped into different families according to the traits they share (alphabets, vocabulary, grammar, sounds, and so on). Often languages share a common root ( e.g., Neo-Latin languages, “aquam” in Latin, “acqua” in Italian, “agua” in Spanish) and then undergo an evolutionary path that causes them to diverge. These principles have been used by linguists, to look for similarities and common patterns in order to decipher dead languages.AI has been shown to be capable of finding patterns and finding similarities. Therefore, this approach has been attempted to try to decode lost languages such as Ugaritic or Linear B. In this case, the authors used a model based on LSTM and embedding and obtained some interesting results. The approach used, does nothing more than look for spans in the lost texts with known tokens.Recent years have seen a large effort to digitize art. Major museums (such as the MET)have created large databases of paintings, books, statues, objects, artifacts, and so on. Often these huge digital libraries are accessible to the public and scholars free of charge. The institutions themselves are moving towards coordinated initiatives. For instance, the European Union has created guidelines to digitize the immense cultural heritage.These initiatives are aimed at democratizing access to collections and cultural heritage. Indeed, many works preserved in museums can be seen by the public simply by visiting the sites. Moreover, museums only display a small part of their collections (many works are stored in warehouses and are never exhibited except in rare exhibitions) so these initiatives allow access to works that normally could not be seen. On the one hand, these initiatives allow valuable resources for scholars who want to study the works. On the other hand, algorithms need data and this allows increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence models to be trained.As we have seen, works, however, preserved in a museum, are delicate objects and can be lost at any time. Safeguarding them is an important and difficult job, whether it is to preserve them or restore them. In these tasks, artificial intelligence can help (monitoring, studying them, and so on). On the other hand, technology needs to be backed by policies and investments to preserve heritage.Not least, AI has developed at great speed in recent years and interesting perspectives open up for the increasingly powerful models. In fact, as we have seen many of the models used are convolutional networks that have proven to be efficient for tasks involving images. However, all other areas of machine learning can be used as well. In fact, for example, unsupervised clustering can be used to group ceramic fragments.In addition, the first models that were used to reconstruct inscriptions and translate dead languages were based on encoder-decoders and LSTMs. Pythia also used the same architecture, but already the later DeepMind Ithaca article was based on a transformer-like architecture. As vision transformers are shown to be effective for imaging we can expect more similar models in the coming years.Another note is how it is not necessarily necessary to develop new and sophisticated algorithms for new tasks: as we have seen some researchers have leveraged DALL-E which is publicly accessible via a website. This shows that many of the available algorithms could be repurposed in the future.Aside from technical demonstrations of AI capabilities, it opens up real perspectives and impact. For example, having a good digital image is the first step in restoring a painting or mosaic. Also, many archaeological sites are understaffed and surveillance is expensive and problematic. Not to mention that AI will be able to help make decisions, prioritize interventions, and reduce costs.Open ethical questions certainly remain. The result as seen with the mosaics should be taken carefully. After all, the model sometimes more than reconstructing history seems to be rewriting it. As in the case of Rembrandt's painting, the algorithm tries to guess based on the data at its disposal, and in fact, the curators of the exhibition pointed out the separation between the original part and what has been reconstructed.In addition, satellite imagery and LIDAR technology have identified thousands of new archaeological sites not yet explored. These may be excavated by grave robbers long before archaeologists can work on them. As important as it is to consider publishing the data, one must also move cautiously.Another thorny case is restorations. Since the 19th century, every new technology has been exploited in restoration without considering the possible damage. For example, concrete has burdened structures causing sometimes more damage than expected.You can look for my other articles, you can also subscribe to get notified when I publish articles, and you can also connect or reach me on LinkedIn.

I remember that year because of our class photos. For my picture day, I wore a crème crewneck sweater and green skirt and my hair was done in two pigtail braids. I am smiling with these big round happy eyes. My mother had chosen the two-image format with a black glossy background, so there were two images of me on the page: one centered and one slightly upper left. It was a more expensive option, but my mom wanted to try something slightly more dramatic. The photos arrived at the school and we were each given our envelope. I pulled out my photos with excitement and was thinking how pleased my mom would be to see them when my teacher, Ms. Murray, walked by, stooped over to see them and said, “You look like a two-headed monkey.” She stood up and walked on to look at the photo of the next child. I just sat there, sad, confused and embarrassed. What had I done wrong? Why was I not pretty? The joy in that moment disappeared quicker than a breath. Of course, I went home and told my mother. Of course, she came to school the next day and handled that teacher. But, I never forgot what was said or how I felt. It still hurts.Needless to say, listening to what Councilwoman Nury Martinez said about her colleague’s Black son brought back those painful memories. Listening to all of the tapes brought deeper reflection and reaction about the perilous state of trust and democracy in Los Angeles, across this country and the globe.I released a statement on Monday and I hadn’t planned to write about this, but I was interviewed yesterday for an article on the impact of the events in Los Angeles and after reading it, I realized so much was left out of the story — important things. I could wait for another interview, or I could share it with you. I have decided to share.The tapes in question are the recordings of Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez, Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León and Labor Leader Ron Herrera. These tapes, made without their knowledge or consent, were released over this past weekend and have whiplashed across this country.I am disgusted but I’m not surprised. People say disparaging things about Black people every single day. I still have PTSD from listening to colleagues on the Senate floor use behaviors of incarcerated “Black criminals” as a means to justify killing legislation that would send to voters an amendment removing involuntary servitude from the state’s constitution. It turns out, people say shameful things about everyone else too. Jewish people, Armenians, the LGBTQ community, Indigenous peoples, progressives, White people and former labor leaders were all given some time on these tapes. It was a smorgasbord of the most polarizing kind of political commentary, and it triggered friends and colleagues up and down this state.This is also not new. Those kinds of discussions are happening everywhere and all the time. They are happening across California and the country. Every day, people are strategizing about how to take, retain and expand their power. The Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments on the legality of gerrymandering Black voters in Alabama. Georgia is in a continued battle to suppress the Black vote as the state, once again, tries to elect Stacy Abrams as Governor. Here in Los Angeles, four leaders discussed how to disenfranchise Black voters, suppress the Black voice and push Black elected officials out of power. It has happened. It just happened. It will happen again. Unless we talk about it.We have to talk about expanding the pie rather than pitting communities against each other for the crumbs. We have to talk about representation that sees everyone and in which everyone benefits. I know that the immediate response is to force these people to resign. That is important and might even feel victorious, but the harder, more meaningful work is in developing policies and practices and reshaping budgets in ways that fundamentally do not harm or erase Black communities. Ironically, in doing so, everyone benefits. Ultimately, we have to talk about how to share power in order to grow power.That has borne out in the legacy of district representation by so many African-American elected officials. In California, most African Americans elected do not represent majority African-American districts. The City of San Francisco is 5.7% African-American. The County of Los Angeles is 8% African-American. The 30th Senate District is 23% African-American. None of these are majority African-American and yet they all have African-American female leadership. Trust is earned through representation when your constituency feels and believes that you will not ignore them.That lost trust, as a result of those tapes, has put Los Angeles in peril.Trust in government is the most important thing. Sometimes it’s the only thing. Colleagues must trust each other to get legislation and budgets passed. Constituents must trust the officials they elect to lead. When trust is lost, government stops working. When government stops working, democracy is lost. The last four years have crystalized a reality that this shared project called democracy is something we cannot afford to break. What must happen next is the resigning of positions, followed by the repairing and regaining of trust by those four leaders with their colleagues, their constituents and their city. We all have a responsibility to make sure that happens — for the sake of our labor movement, our civic structure and our future.I believe that part of the work includes who we elect as our next Mayor. Congresswoman Karen Bass is running and she is on the precipice of becoming the first Black female Mayor of Los Angeles. I know her work as a Congresswoman, Speaker of the State Assembly and founder of the non-profit Community Coalition. She is a woman of high integrity and humility and she leads with an intense desire to create shared belonging and ownership. This city is at a crossroads and is in crisis. We are buckling under homelessness, the rising cost of living and a growing fear of one another. Congresswoman Bass does not wave a magic wand and she is not a miracle worker, but she does have extensive muscle memory when it comes to easing tensions and building coalitions. In 1992, when South LA was rocked by the crack epidemic, racial violence and economic neglect, she tapped into the most important asset in the community — the people — in order to galvanize change. I think she can do it again in 2022. In fact, I am banking on her skill-set over that of her opponent, just like I am banking on me and the wave of fresh leadership running in so many other seats across this city and country that want profound, foundational, uplifting change. I want to believe in my government and I want my government to believe in me.California is not as progressive as we espouse. We are still a state in process. In fact, some have called us the Mississippi of the West. While we have certainly seen the debilitating side of politics over these last days, we will recover. My mother always says that sunlight is the best disinfectant and I believe her. We have an opportunity to lean into what is uncomfortable about race, power, and anti-Blackness and create the kind of future that has space for us all. Let’s not waste this chance.And no, Ms. Murray, I was not a two-headed monkey.

After working my ass off for 25 years, I became an overnight success: speaking gigs, appearances on cable news and talk shows, book and podcast deals. I spent a bunch of time with elected officials, and powerful people wanted to have lunch with me. People were fascinated — shocked, even — by this simple observation: Big Tech is powerful, maybe too powerful.Much of the concern was a function of the ad-driven nature of platforms — algorithms that tapped into good/bad aspects of human nature to addict us. Most people knew how Facebook and Google made money, but not how they actually worked, how the ad revenue was fueled by the collection of data and the harvesting of attention. In fact, the phrase “Big Tech” was barely known back then. (Check the Wikipedia entry for Big Tech and see which NYU professor is credited with defining the category.) I just read the last sentence and realized I still crave other people’s affirmation. #Pathetic.Anyway, things are different today. We know we’re being tracked, and we understand how digital platforms make money. We also know they’re lucrative, as in, among the fastest growing, most profitable businesses in history. Since A Beautiful Mind won Best Picture in 2002, Google has grown its revenue 625-fold. Digital ads transformed the company from a garage project into a multinational corporation, and turned Meta from a college-campus website into the largest media business in the world. If you had to bet everything, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go with whoever controls our attention. Meta or Google? Safe bets. Snap? Riskier, but the moppets love it. It’s fun to flirt with other sectors and firms, but these companies are the smart, safe bets.Until now.This is proving to be a historically bad year for tech. Few saw it coming. If you bought Facebook stock in 2015, you’ve lost money. If you purchased shares of General Motors, IBM, or Chevron, you’ve made more money than Meta shareholders. Seven years of gains, erased in 10 months. Meta’s meltdown is shocking, but not singular. Google is down 40% this year, Amazon 45%, and Snap 80%. These losses are unprecedented in the Big Tech era.As with bankruptcy, the sell-off happened gradually, then suddenly. Last week was a turning point. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Snap all missed big on earnings. The common theme? Ads. Or lack thereof. We knew the Mad Men era had come to an end; we weren’t expecting the end of Ad Men. But let’s be honest, advertising sucks. Cable ads provide a glimpse into what it’s like to have restless leg syndrome, and digital ads, while more relevant, are carbon — the noxious byproduct of converting attention into shareholder value via algorithms that bring out the worst in the species. I’ll say it again, advertising sucks.In a surprising turn of events, ads have become Big Tech’s Achilles’ heel. Google’s ad revenue grew just 3% this quarter, down from 43% growth a year ago. For the first time, YouTube ad revenue declined. Snap registered its slowest ad revenue growth ever. Meta’s ad sales, which make up more than 98% of the business, were a trainwreck. Meanwhile (and yes, this brings me joy) the company continues to incinerate $2 billion a month feeding Mark’s fever dream that he is a god of new worlds. BTW, it appears people are more likely to worship Tom: Myspace has more traffic than Meta’s Horizon Worlds.What is/are the meteor(s) that have struck the Genghis & Khan of ads? Meta says the problem is “the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape.” Google blames “the challenging macroclimate.” Snap, “macro headwinds.” Macro, as in, rising inflation, interest rates, and supply chain issues all conspiring to depress advertising demand. And it makes sense, because if people stop spending money on stuff, then the businesses that make that stuff have less money to spend on advertising.But here’s where it gets scary for these companies’ shareholders: The “macro” culprit is a ghost, as people haven’t stopped spending. U.S. consumer spending beat expectations in September, rising 0.6% for the second month in a row. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is doing, well, fine — U.S. GDP grew 2.6% last quarter. Of course, there’s still a lot of uncertainty. Growth has slowed, and we’re by no means in the clear. But the weakness we’re seeing in the macroeconomy is a drizzle compared to the Category 5 shitstorm we’re seeing in digital advertising.The state of the economy is a distraction here. Something else is killing ads, and tech companies are reluctant to acknowledge it because, unlike the economy, it’s not cyclical but structural.The elephants in the room are Apple and TikTok. Apple is the larger of the two, figuratively and literally. Last week, the Cupertino giant cemented its position as the most enduring tech company in history: Facing the same macro headwinds as Google and Meta, Apple beat earnings expectations on both the top and bottom lines. At $2.4 trillion in market cap, the company is roughly 10 times more valuable than Meta. Three years ago, it was twice as valuable. It’s getting easier to understand why the Zuck wants out of this universe.Apple may be the last thing an ad-driven platform sees before everything goes black. A year ago, Apple’s iOS upgrade forced apps, including Facebook and Instagram, to ask users for permission to track their data. Meta relies on that data to serve personalized ads that garner greater clicks and sales. So if users opt out, the ads become less effective, and Meta, dramatically less valuable.But few predicted the change would hurt Meta this much. Turns out when Apple’s privacy prompt pops up, only 16% of users agree to being tracked. And if data is the new oil, ad platforms are losing 84% of their Brent Crude. Apple has gone Putin on Meta’s Germany by cutting supply — though this decision was positioned more virtuously, in the name of privacy, vs. war.Without data, the digital ad ecosystem doesn’t work. I saw this play out in real time. Here at Prof G Media, we collect data — specifically, whether or not you opened this email. It’s not powerful data, but it’s data. It helps us understand what resonates. However, several months ago our open rate fell off a cliff. Why? Apple’s privacy change: Every iPhone reader started showing up as a no-open. Overnight, our data had become useless.This newsletter isn’t monetized, so the data blackbox isn’t a game changer. But for most online businesses, it’s dire. Small e-commerce companies across the country have seen customer acquisition costs skyrocket … by 10 times. Why? The ads are no longer shown to the right people at the right time. As a result, small businesses have had to shift spend. Since the iOS upgrade, almost half of e-commerce store owners have decreased their Facebook ad spending by 25% or more. This year, the average price of ads on Meta declined 20%. One year ago, before the privacy change, prices had risen 20%. Tim’s revenge turned Meta, overnight, from a spry, twentysomething growth stock into a Golden Girl, mature and complaining.In advertising, the pie stays the same. The industry has consistently accounted for roughly 1.3% of U.S. GDP. Which means a couple things: 1) There’s always demand, and 2) it’s a zero-sum game. As with foreign exchange, every increase is met with a commensurate decrease somewhere else.So if the money isn’t going to Facebook, where is it going? The phantom menace here is likely TikTok. Last quarter (the same quarter Google, Meta, and Snap got crushed), TikTok was the highest-grossing app for the fourth consecutive quarter — meanwhile, the rest of the app market declined. It was also the most downloaded app on the App Store, and more than a quarter of Americans under 30 now get their news from it. TikTok’s global ad revenue will triple this year, to $12 billion, which would best the revenue of Snap and Twitter combined. That number doesn’t include Douyin, TikTok’s China-based counterpart. ByteDance, the parent company that houses these assets, was recently valued at $300 billion. That’s roughly equal to Meta, Snap, and Twitter (at Elon’s inflated price) combined.TikTok’s growing influence is well documented. We’ve discussed it many times before. Less discussed is the extent to which Xi and Cook have formed an unspoken alliance to repel the advance of Meta. The company is in full-blown retreat. After Facebook and Instagram ads became less effective, ad buyers overwhelmingly turned to TikTok. Standard practice, according to one ad firm, was to move 10% to 15% of ad spend from Facebook to TikTok. The data is opaque (part and parcel of ByteDance being China-owned), but the trend is clear: TikTok is becoming the premier ad platform.You’d think TikTok would be just as susceptible to Apple’s privacy change as Facebook. After all, TikTok’s ads are fueled by an algorithm, which is fed with your data. But research suggests TikTok is more insulated against Apple’s privacy change than others. According to cybersecurity experts, TikTok can circumvent Apple’s code audits and track activity without the user’s knowledge. Exactly how this works is (again) not so clear, and that’s the point — as one expert pointed out, “ByteDance has gone to monumental lengths to conceal the inner workings of the app.” What could go wrong?I’m on a plane as I write this, taking my sons to see the Glasgow Rangers play St. Johnstone in Perth, Scotland. We are football mad, and I want my sons to see my dad’s favorite team in a 10,000-seat stadium. I’m trying to re-create a memory my dad used to tell me about, when he and his father went to this same game — the Rangers were his team. He’d get emotional talking about that day, one of his few memories of doing something, alone, with his father.About 20 years ago, I stopped dwelling on my dad’s shortcomings, put the bullshit aside, and decided to be the son I’d like to be … full stop. The catalyst for this was his sister telling me he’d been physically abused by his father. He had never mentioned this. The idea that the person you should trust most would beat you, and the damage that must do to a young soul, is unthinkable. When I told my dad about our trip, he didn’t remember who the Rangers were. He’s 92 and struggling. As his attention and memories are disappearing, I’m riddled with questions that will likely never be answered: What planes did he repair while serving in the Royal Navy? My mom, his second wife, told me his first wife tried to kill herself after he told her he was leaving her — is this true? A difficult subject I never had the confidence to broach. All of a sudden, a ton of questions.This weekend, I will take a bunch of videos of us rooting for the Rangers and send them to my father. I’ll also send them to my sons with a voiceover. I will tell them what I know of their grandfather’s affinity for the Rangers. I’ll also tell them that I have no interest in football, but love it because they love it, and it makes me feel closer to them. And that when they were born, for the first time, I knew I had purpose.

Even more often, I find myself to be the only first-generation immigrant who learned English as a second language.This is interesting given almost 27% of the population in California is foreign-born immigrants and 45% of people speak a different language at home.Was I luckier? Was I smarter? Probably not.I have been pondering what made me different and how I leveraged my unique immigrant experience for the last 20 years in the U.S. I hope that others like me can benefit from my story.Once upon a time in 1999, I flew from Korea to San Francisco with only a single piece of luggage in my hand. Many people would say this sounds like the American dream.But living and studying in the U.S. wasn’t all unicorns and rainbows. Overcoming the language barrier was harder than I’d expected. Grammar was all backwards from Korean, and there were so many words, idioms, expressions and nuances I had to learn from the scratch. My brain, ears, and mouth always seemed uncoordinated. I always felt overly self-conscious about my word choices, and I worried whether people even understood me. Looking back, it probably took me 10+ years to feel comfortable ordering a pizza over the phone.Cultural adjustment was even harder. When I was growing up back in Korea, I was trained to listen and read between the lines. Classes were usually one-way lectures, and I didn’t learn how to form and express an original opinion. Being opinionated or expressing emotions was considered rebellious, pompous or rude.When I studied Design at the California College of the Arts, I behaved like the good student I was taught to be — obedient and hard-working. However, professors used to put me on the spot for being too quiet in the corner. I felt guilty for not being able to contribute in class, but it was even more terrifying not to know how to behave differently.There were numerous times when I wanted to leave it all behind and go back to Korea where could comfortably blend in with people who had similar backgrounds, spoke the same language, and understood me for who I was. However, I didn’t like the idea of resigning and was determined to stand on my feet in the U.S.20 years later, I’m glad I didn’t give up, and I treasure those difficult yet unique experiences that helped me become the person I am today. There are many things that I learned to appreciate because I’ve lived a foreigner’s life. They also influenced my leadership style in the following way:My constant worry that people may not have understood me and the realization that I could no longer just “read between the lines” has turned me into an over-communicator and a straight shooter. I would rather be a leader who is an open book than a mysterious black box. I find that proactive communication and directness helps get people on the same page faster and prevents second guessing. It’s important for me to know that my team stays up to date so they can make the best informed decision, and I don’t become the blocker of critical data.Because English is a second language, the reality is that I will never be as eloquent or inspiring with my words as native speakers. Realizing this helped me develop into a doer with a strong bias toward action. I don’t feel as engaged sitting in meetings full of endless philosophical discussions that don’t lead to any progress. I’m most satisfied when we get down to actually solving the problem and moving the needle. I also love working with and hiring other doers who can move mountains with me in the most productive and efficient way possible. Because of this trait, I feel I am most useful in situations where execution is key.Vividly remembering the devastating feeling of “I’m not understood for who I am” taught me the importance of creating an authentic environment where everyone is accepted. This includes individuals’ different backgrounds, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. People can only excel and perform when they can be who they are. Pretentious, disingenuous culture is toxic, and it makes people focus on things other than the quality of work itself. I strive to build an open, honest, and transparent culture where everyone feels safe to make mistakes, freely talk about their experiences, and learn from each other.Having been the vulnerable person who was silently sitting in the corner, it’s important for me to include everyone in the room. I love leading discussions where everyone felt their voices were heard (introverts and extroverts alike) and they contributed to something big and meaningful. This doesn’t mean including everyone in every meeting and asking everyone for their opinion. This means that meetings need to be more thoughtfully and intentionally “designed” — from room/location, time, duration, agenda, and attendees. Even small things like sending the agenda in advance and recapping the meeting outcomes afterwards helps every meeting become more inclusive and participatory.I always picture what each meeting will look like in my head before scheduling it. What are the potential conversation dynamics and outcomes? What should the tone of the discussion be? Whose voice will be loudest in the room and who might feel more isolated? Some may think this is overly calculated, but I believe this is the minimal amount of preparation you need to do as an empathetic leader.In Korean, there’s a concept called “noon-chi.” It’s almost impossible to find the exact equivalent in English, but the best possible translation is probably “tact.” It’s the skill of reading between the lines and acting sensibly based on a tactful interpretation of the situation. This is the virtue I was taught in Korea. It’s the sixth sense that enables you to read people’s emotional states and relate to them. When noon-chi is combined with empathy, authenticity, and self-awareness, you can lead teams with high emotional intelligence.Emotional intelligence also isn’t a mythical qualification for leaders and managers. It’s something we should be looking for in every hire because they are our future leadership bench. In interviews, I try to keenly observe the following things about each candidate: Do they interact with team members respectfully throughout the process? Are they self-aware? Do they want what we’re looking for? Can they put themselves in other people’s shoes? Even small things like turning their laptop screen toward others (even if it means they have to read their presentations upside down) go a long way.There are a lot of first-generation immigrants in the U.S., yet it was hard to find an article about everyday leadership by immigrant leaders.Hopefully this article will shed light on the subject from a different angle and inspire others who are going through similar experiences. I’d love to stay connected in the immigrant design community and learn from everyone’s stories.

Enormous advances in underlying language modeling technology, coupled with the early success of products like Github CoPilot, have led to a huge array of founders using LLMs to rethink workflows ranging from code reviews to copywriting to analyzing unstructured product feedback.Much has been written about this emerging ecosystem — I would recommend the excellent articles by Elad Gil, Leigh Marie Braswell, and Vinay Iyengar as starting points — and in general, it is exciting to see so many nascent startups in this area. However, I worry that many startups in this space are focusing on the wrong things early on. Specifically, after having met and looked into numerous companies in this space, it seems that UX and product design is the predominant bottleneck holding back most applied large language model startups, not data or modeling.This article will explain why I think this is the case, highlight many of the key UX issues I observe, and offer recommendations for how a founder building on top of LLMs might account for this.To start, let me paint a picture of the common journey I see many language model startups go through.A technically superb founding team starts with a vision of a big use case that can be obviously re-imagined with current language model technology. They throw together a pitch deck that looks something like the following:90% of the team’s early focus is on data, modeling, system architecture, and technical defensibility. The team is likely hyper-aware of the fact that many people believe LLMs are becoming commoditized, and as a result, tries to spend a lot of time articulating why their technical approach is unique and not easily mimicked by a hobbyist just using GPT-3.After fundraising and a lot of time building, the startup eventually gets an MVP of the product together and puts it in front of customers. The demo blows prospects away, but then, things seem to fade. The prospect tries it out in a POC, but the novelty runs out, and they stop using it. Engagement is low. The customer churns. Despite how incredible the demo is, the startup struggles to find real product market fit.In my experience, the root cause that typically drives this outcome is that it is extraordinarily hard to teach a human how to work together with a probabilistic system in an environment where they are not used to one. Any language model startup that is designed to be human-in-the-loop (which is the vast majority) will need to implicitly answer the following types of questions for their users:These are, first and foremost, UX questions that require very careful design thinking and user research to solve. If you forgo such work and simply throw a naked GPT-3 text prompt into your UI, or just make a raw API call to the GPT-3 API every time the user presses a given hotkey, you are essentially asking the user to figure these things out on their own. The cognitive burden on users to figure such questions out via trial and error is immense. So if you don’t identify how to craft your product in a way that makes these answers so obvious to your users that they can get it in <5 minutes, they are very likely to give up on your product once the novelty effect wears off.In my experience, despite these UX questions being the critical bottleneck to product market fit and the hardest thing to get right in most cases, they are chronically undervalued by most startups in this space. Indeed, if you speak with some of the few companies who have actually built widely adopted applied LLM products, you’ll find that almost universally they ended up having to spend more time on UX and the human-computer interface as they did on modeling.I believe there are a few underlying factors that lead so many teams to pay such little attention to these sorts of UX questions despite their criticality.First, these issues really only surface once someone starts trying to use the product in the context of their daily workflow. This market is characterized by an immense gap between a prospect being impressed or interested in a demo to actually converting to a paid and engaged user for precisely this reason. I believe this is also why many of the PLG and self-service applied LLM startups have high churn — on first use, the product is “cool,” but after some time, you realize it is too difficult to use effectively.Second, many teams believe that improved model accuracy can allow them to avoid deeply considering these questions from a product & design perspective. Unfortunately, these challenges are essentially always present, regardless of your system’s accuracy (within some bounds). It doesn’t really matter if your LLM accuracy is 80% or 95%, as in either case, the user still needs to reason through failure modalities and understand what to expect when interacting with the system. Since you’re almost certainly not going to achieve 100% accuracy unless you have scoped down the use case to something extremely specific, you are generally better off getting to a baseline accuracy that is good enough and then building a product that allows a user to know how to work around the model (this paper on using language models to help write short stories is an excellent illustration of this concept).Finally, there is a talent issue — most of the people building in this space come from research, Ph.D., or engineering backgrounds and simply don’t consider product and design decisions like this as first-class problems to solve.To further explain why the UX of interfacing with LLMs is so hard to get right, let’s briefly explore one of the most popular emerging LLM use cases — copywriting. There are a number of notable companies utilizing GPT-3 or similar models for copywriting, such as Jasper.ai, Copy.ai, and Anyword. At a high level, these products all work in the following way — you tell it what you’re trying to write (e.g. advertising header), you provide some context (e.g. product description), and it generates suggestions for you which theoretically convert users at a high rate.If you try these products yourself or speak to people who use them, you’ll find that the chief factor that differentiates them is not model accuracy. All of them are pretty good at optimizing copy for conversion, and frankly, it is not possible for a user to meaningfully compare the quality of the output copy without putting extensive time into manually A/B testing the services. In other words — differences in model accuracy are essentially imperceptible to the user. What does immediately differentiate the products from a user’s perspective, however, is the “periphery” of the product around the core language synthesis engine.For example:Solving these sorts of UX questions well has a substantially larger impact on a user’s ability to select good copy that they are happy with than marginally fine-tuning a language model to be slightly better at copywriting suggestions.Indeed, many companies in this category have high churn, and I suspect that the vast majority of variance in churn/retention/engagement across such startups is driven by these UX-related factors. Products that handle them poorly are fun to try, but difficult to trust and hard to reason about over time. Products that handle them well are magical — using them feels effortless, and it is clear to understand how they fit into a real workflow.At this point, I’ve hopefully convinced you that it is important to think about the UX of how a human will interact with an LLM in the context of your product. But how might you actually go about doing that, and what are the right design patterns?While this space is extraordinarily early, and there is a lot to be figured out, I want to share some common themes I see emerging in the hope that it sparks your imagination and gets you thinking. For each, I’ll reference several emerging startups that are doing interesting things in the context of that UX pattern.If you’ve ever used Gmail, you have likely come across the “smart compose” feature. As you type a sentence, Gmail occasionally flashes a suggested auto-complete in grey. The user can either quickly accept it or keep typing and ignore it.This feature is quite delightful to use because it is simple to understand, very accurate, and requires zero cognitive effort on the part of the user. I would argue that most of these benefits stem from the fact that these suggestions are system-prompted, not user-prompted. Suggestions are only shown when there is confidence that the result is very high quality, and the “push” based nature of the suggestions means that the user does not even need to be aware that this feature exists to utilize it.Although smart compose is not technically built using LLMs, I would argue that these principles very cleanly translate to most LLM startups. The more you can move away from a user-driven invocation of the model to an automatic triggering of the model in the right instances, the more you can ensure that model output is perceived to be extremely trustworthy and high quality, and the less work you are asking the user to do. In your product, if it is critical to give the user more flexibility on when and how to trigger the model, I would explore different ways to “hint” to the user when the model is more likely to be effective or accurate vs. not.An emerging area of research within language models is the field of “prompt engineering.” Researchers have realized that for a wide class of language model tasks, changing the way you prompt the model results in a massive delta in the accuracy of the model’s results.A fun example of this is that if you ask language models to solve math problems, simply adding the phrase “Let’s think step by step” results in much higher accuracy.The fact that there is an entire research field around prompt engineering hints at a broader point — it is really, really complex to figure out how to interface with a large language model, and subtle differences in the way you “speak” with it can have a massive impact on how useful it is. The critical implication of this is you don’t want to force users of your product to be prompt engineering researchers.Unfortunately, this is the status quo for interacting with foundation models in most products today. In language generation, most products expose fairly “naked” text boxes, and the user is left trying to test and experiment with what creates a good output. One automated email follow-up tool I tried still required me to type “Write an email…” as the start of my prompt to get a good output.To the extent possible, I would strongly encourage building an abstraction layer between what the user inputs and what you actually prompt the model with. A simple but good example of this is TattoosAI, which is a tattoo image generation application. Note that the user interface has abstracted things like style, color, and artist into categorical drop-downs and specific fields. Under the hood, the product clearly converts those categorical values into very specific prompts, which generate good tattoo results. This would otherwise be extraordinarily difficult for a user to get right on their own by directly prompting a model like Stable Diffusion.I suspect that, in many cases, it is not a good idea to provide a single open text field input as the primary way a user interfaces with your model. This likely gives too much freedom to your user and, as a result, opens them up to too many weird failure modalities based on not knowing the right way to talk to the model. Instead, identify constrained, defined situations where the model should be queried and productize that in such a way that the user hopefully can’t mess it up.One of the biggest hurdles to overcome when building an LLM-based application is trust. As a user, to what extent can I default assume the output is good, versus to what extent do I need to double-check the output? The more the user needs to validate everything that the machine produces, the less the machine is actually providing any value.Code autocompletion is an interesting case study in this context. Products like Github CoPilot and Replit AI mode are some of the earliest breakout use cases of large language models — CoPilot has hundreds of thousands of subscribers paying over $100 a year for the service, and many people love the product.Yet, if you talk to a wide enough sample of people who use CoPilot, you will sometimes hear mixed feedback. Specifically, CoPilot regularly suggests code snippets that are incorrect and doesn’t compile or contain errors, meaning that engineers must very carefully analyze code suggestions before moving forward. Essentially, CoPilot introduces a tradeoff between spending less time writing boilerplate code and spending more time reading “someone else’s” code (aka the LLM).It is very interesting to contrast this with Google’s recent work in LLM-based code autocompletion. Specifically, Google has built a hybrid code completion system that is not only based on transformer models but also incorporates semantic engines, which are essentially the rule-based auto-complete systems that have traditionally powered code suggestions in IDEs. The combination of these systems allows for two forms of advanced auto-complete that significantly mitigate user trust issues:Interestingly, Google directly tested pure LLM based autocomplete suggestions and found that there was a much lower user acceptance rate for them due to trust issues:This leads to a common drawback of ML-powered code completion whereby the model may suggest code that looks correct but doesn’t compile. Based on internal user experience research, this issue can lead to the erosion of user trust over time while reducing productivity gains….The acceptance rate for single-line completions improved by 1.9x over the first six weeks of incorporating the feature, presumably due to increased user trust. As a comparison, for languages where we did not add semantic checking, we only saw a 1.3x increase in acceptance.Replit’s AI mode follows similar principles — “We apply a collection of heuristic filters to decide to discard, truncate or otherwise transform some suggestions; soon, we’ll also apply a reinforcement learning layer to understand the kinds of suggestion that are helpful to users, filtering out suggestions that are unlikely to be accepted to prioritize suggestions that are genuinely helpful.Generalizing this, I find that many best-in-class LLM-based products complement the LLM with some form of validation checks (often heuristic in nature) to avoid errant output. It can be catastrophic to suggest something to a user that seems nonsensical or obviously wrong. So especially if you have a product that allows a user to trigger the model in arbitrary situations, it often becomes essential to build mechanisms to mitigate the chances of this.Of course, not all use cases have validation checks as simple as testing whether code can compile. As such, I would also recommend thinking about affordances you can build that allow the user to know when to gut-check the output as well as how to gut-check the output. This might involve building some testing or evaluation framework that the user can use to define domain-specific tests or invariants that they want to hold, or it might involve workflows that ask the user to test/verify the output and edit it in certain cases.Debuild is a good example of a simple app that has approached validation affordances well. Debuild allows you to create simple web applications with natural language — you start by typing something like “A to-do list that allows me to track, edit, and input tasks in a hierarchical format,” and it will create a React application based on this. Importantly, the workflow of the application natively incorporates debugging, testing, and validation steps. After you type the initial natural language prompt, rather than take you straight to the output, it takes you through a number of intermediate validation steps. For example — it shows you a list of “use cases” it believes your app needs to support based on the natural language prompt, and it allows you to edit/modify that list before moving on.This step-by-step, validation-oriented workflow takes a use case that would likely otherwise be way too frustrating — as there is too much room for the LLM to get things wrong if you try to do everything at once — and makes it very delightful. As a user, I implicitly understand when I am expected to validate the output and how I am expected to do that, and as a result, I don’t really mind if the machine sometimes is a little bit wrong.Related to this, I think there is a lot of room for LLM-based products to explore richer error messaging and fallback workflows. Rather than defaulting to always showing the model output, explore whether there are ways to predict or guess when the output may be low quality or uncertain. In such instances, see if you can do something different from a product perspective. This might involve sanitizing the user input and throwing an error message if the user prompt is too “weird” in one way or another. It might involve analyzing the confidence of the LLM’s response and either not showing the response or showing it with a warning if the confidence is too low (with the caveat that the “proper” way to analyze the confidence level of an LLM inference is an active area of research which is still not well understood). It might involve analyzing the output and putting the user into a fallback “you need to check this output” workflow under certain situations. I think there is a lot of design space to be explored here.Most generative products built around LLMs today are “stateless” in the sense that you provide an input, you get an output, and nothing about that interaction influences the future behavior of the model.Yet, in my experience, this structure does not align well with how humans like to approach creative thinking. The creative process is typically much more iterative, with each step derived from the last. For example:In this sense, creative idea generation is often “stateful” — each step plays off the last step’s output. I suspect most applied LLM products focused on creative generation or synthesis will likely benefit from treating user interactions more like sessions where the user can see some initial outputs, highlight what they like or don’t like, and then further nudge the model in the direction they want the output to go.Many emerging LLM-based copywriting tools are starting to do basic versions of this. Copy.ai allows you to pick initial suggestions you like and generate “More like this,” while Anyword allows you to highlight outputs and “rephrase” them, which changes the wording but preserves the core meaning.You can imagine many more sophisticated versions of this, where the system allows you to very elegantly define what characteristics you like in certain outputs (wording, tone, style, structure, length, etc), as well as what types of changes you want to make. These sorts of features offer users a much greater feeling of control and help users avoid the frustrations that can stem from re-prompting the model from scratch and “losing” something you liked a lot but which was just a little bit off.The fact that accuracy and trust will be an issue for many of these models greatly exacerbates the importance of this concept. If you build in the right affordances for the user to deal with “bad” output and select for “good” output via an iterative process, you drastically reduce the perceived negative impact of bad suggestions. Implicitly, this design tells the user not to expect that the model’s output will be perfect and gives them the tools to deal with that. This is a much more realistic mental model for how a user should interact with the LLM in most situations.Some of the most delightful implementations of LLMs that I have used thus far are built to solve extremely specific and narrow workflows, such as AutoRegex, which converts English to regular expressions, and Warp’s tool for converting natural language to CLI commands. Both of these tools tackle an extremely narrow subset of language generation, and the result is compelling. The model essentially always does exactly what you expect it to do as a user, the perceived accuracy is very high, and there is no confusion as a user about how to prompt, trigger or use the model.When you compare this with more general products, such as LLM-based text editors like Lex, the difference in user experience is profound. While Lex is extremely cool and fun to use, to me, it still feels much closer to a novelty and much further from a core tool that I can use day to day. It is simply too challenging to understand when to trigger the model and to guess what it will write.Many startups in this space have begun to realize this. If you look at the evolution of the LLM-based copywriting products, many have gone from more general copywriting interfaces to highly segmented UIs for very specific copywriting use cases— e.g., Copy.ai has different parts of the product for writing “Facebook Primary Text,” “Facebook Headlines,” and “Facebook Link Descriptions.” In the automated code review space, I see many of the best startups starting by focusing on specific code ecosystems (e.g., Rust) and specific classes of code review use cases (e.g., style errors).The most commonly discussed benefit of specificity is that it may allow for a more specialized, fine-tuned model to be used, leading either to performance improvements or a latency/cost reduction. While this is certainly true, it is far from the only benefit. Constraining the use case also allows you to make much more opinionated product and UX decisions at the interface between the model and the human and abstract much more of the model prompting and model output.For example, many companies working on analyzing unstructured user feedback via LLMs, such as Viable and Enterpret have moved away from highly prompt-driven user interfaces where a user can ask whatever they want. Instead, they focus more on “out of the box,” segmented use cases such as trending negative feedback or new feedback tied to a specific recent release of the product. This approach removes the need for the user to identify what to ask the model as well as the right way to prompt it — the user doesn’t need to come up with the idea that analyzing trending negative feedback might be a good idea, nor do they need to figure out the right way to ask the model to provide trending negative feedback.In coding, there is also a clear trend toward workflow specificity. Replit treats rewriting code, explaining code, and generating code as completely distinct use cases from both a UI perspective and from a model perspective. Some products are beginning to further segment even within code generation, treating full-function code completion based on a function signature (e.g., have the LLM write a function based on a comment) as distinct from in-line code autocomplete (e.g., guess the rest of the line of code I am writing) in terms of how they surface in the UI or are triggered.Similarly, I suspect that most LLM-based word editors will, over time, move away from utilizing a hotkey command as the universal way to trigger an LLM, and move towards much more cleanly defined use cases that are visually surfaced in distinct ways or triggered via different mechanisms. Paragraph generation, sentence or phrase auto-complete, rewording/rewriting, information gathering, and having the model help you “brainstorm” what to write are likely quite distinct in how they should be productized; the Worldcraft paper on short story writing has some great illustrations and examples of this. While segmenting these use cases will certainly allow for individual models to be fine-tuned, I suspect that most of the marginal benefit comes from a simpler-to-understand product that is easier to use, trust, and interface with.The last UX principle worth touching on is latency and performance. Many of the most interesting applied LLM use cases live in the context of a “flow state” task like writing, coding, or similar, which you ideally do not want to interrupt with a loading spinner that lasts 5 seconds. If you are building an LLM-based application, it is worth deeply studying the latency thresholds that your use cases will require to achieve a good UX. From there, you can identify the right model and system architecture.For example, TabNine is a code completion startup that has a very different architecture than Github CoPilot — rather than utilizing one monolithic language model, their product is built around an ensemble of specific models fine-tuned for different types of tasks. Notably, utilizing much smaller models allows them to do inline, real-time code suggestions as you type each character, something CoPilot can not achieve.Replit, similarly, has done extensive optimization work to get their median response time to 400ms. I suspect that virtually all generative writing LLM use cases will benefit massively from hitting the 100ms threshold over time.Although performance improvements are obviously technical in nature, my argument would be that they really need to start from a deep understanding of the user, the user’s workflow, and the user experience you want to create. There is a huge design space of ways to modulate the cost, speed, size, and accuracy tradeoff of language models— selecting different baseline pre-trained models, fine-tuning, prefix tuning, etc. — and in many applications, there are likely pareto optimal points in this search space that should be identified.Tied to this, I suspect that in many cases, there will be other innovative ways to drive performance, such as intelligent use of caching, parallelization of compute, utilizing an ensemble of models (including some small language models or traditional model architectures), clever integrations between semantic/heuristic checks and the language model, and similar. Subtle UX changes can often also result in dramatic differences in perceived performance and should not be discounted. As an example, Replit has its code completion models “stream” the results line by line for multi-line suggestions rather than wait until the whole response can be shown. This results in a very different user perception of speed and a vastly improved UX.The best applied LLM startups will have very strong opinions about where they should sit among these tradeoffs and will likely identify clever system architectures to achieve a differentiated user experience.Many people starting LLM-based companies think a lot about building proprietary data moats or data feedback loops that allow for data or model-driven defensibility over time. I generally think that for the majority of vertical use cases within LLMs, it will be hard to achieve any substantive advantage in this manner — these models are obviously becoming commoditized, and the benefits of marginal accuracy beyond a certain point for most of these use cases are limited, and in many situations, there is enough easily accessible or open data.It is commonly believed that product and UX insights do not generally drive defensibility, given they are easily copied. If one of the copywriting companies figures out the perfect workflow for LLM-assisted copywriting, can’t the other quickly mimic that? While this is true to an extent, it misses something — many UX insights in this space need to be coupled with unique, domain-specific technical work to enable them. Examples of this that have already been touched on in this article include Google’s semantic validation engine for its code completion system and TabNine’s ensemble approach to language modeling to allow for inline code suggestions while the developer types.Superhuman is a good illustrative example of this in a different domain. A lot of what makes Superhuman special is how fast everything is, enabling the user to stay in a flow state, but this was only achieved via extreme engineering effort to ensure every single action in the product happens in <100 ms.I am certain that many applied LLM teams that start by identifying the ideal user experience for their use case will need to do research-level work in explainability, confidence analysis, prompt engineering, performance, testing, and validation, or similar to actually build that user experience. Domain-specific context integration, fine-tuning customer data, and continuous learning are some other interesting areas for unique IP to be developed that will enable improved user experiences. This sort of domain-specific, “user-aware” research is often the hardest type of technical progress for others to duplicate or mimic. Related, I suspect that many enduring startups in this space will build out complex hybrid systems that combine heuristics, symbolic approaches, transformer-based models, and legacy language models in an elegant way.Great startups in this category will think from first principles about the UX they want to deliver and identify truly novel ways to achieve that technically in a way that few others can. The more specific these UX insights are to a specific domain, the better, as the less likely they are to be obviated by general research improvements in large language models.In some sense, much of what I have written about in this article is not particularly new. The central issue of teaching a human how to interact with a probabilistic machine has been true for the vast majority of applied ML companies over the last decade. In each case, you need to figure out how to build a product that “gracefully handles the confusion matrix” and engender trust among the users interacting with the model. Indeed, I think many LLM companies can likely learn an immense amount from the best-in-class ML-enabled creative tools that exist today, such as Runway.Yet, I can’t help but feel that these problems are even harder to solve and more critical to get right in the applied LLM space. This heavily relates to the ambition of startups in this category. It is, frankly, incredible to even consider the idea that machines can so foundationally influence complex, creative, knowledge-worker tasks like writing software. The scope of these tasks is, to some extent, much broader than most previously applied AI workflows, which dramatically increases the importance of creating carefully tuned products with outstanding UX, especially at the interface of the model and the human.It is worth noting that many of these UX questions can be tested, de-risked, and iterated on with a very small amount of money. You can build a hacky prototype with a hard-coded backend to test the interaction pattern — no LLM is required. I think far more startups in the space should do things like this before they build a huge language model stack. Think through all the different ways a user could interact with the product and reason through ways to address the questions I posed at the start of the article. Take an off-the-shelf LLM model and focus on refining the UX of interacting with the product before you try to do anything custom from an architecture or fine-tuning perspective. These are not hard things to do, but so few teams do them.This space desperately needs more founding teams with strong design and product instincts who treat UX as a first-class problem. The foundational interaction patterns for using LLMs have not been figured out, and there is a big opportunity for the startups that are at the forefront of this.If you’re a team like this working on an applied LLM startup and thinking a lot about how to get the human-machine interface right, I’d love to chat with you — feel free to reach out at davis (at) innovationendeavors (dot) com.'], ['Cronkite, Cyborgs, and the Crisis of Democracy', 'Sarah Pessin', 'Oct 5', 'https://medium.com/@sarahpessin/cronkite-cyborgs-and-the-crisis-of-democracy-5c8c37856a3b?source=home---------157------------------0----------', 'Earlier today I attended Denver Dialogues where heads of Right-leaning and Left-leaning national think-tanks were assembled together to talk about ways forward in democracy. In effect, the very form of engaging thinkers from so far across the aisle on a single panel itself seems designed to perform part of a solution: If we talk with our opponents more, we can learn to listen to each other more — even when we disagree deeply.At one point, when asked about the problems of social media, one of the panelists wistfully reflected back on the days of Walter Cronkite when reporting was trustworthy and no one had to worry about fake news or deep fakes. Reflecting on the outdated reference, another of the panelists noted that many of the university students in attendance probably had no idea who Cronkite was — and everyone nodded in lighthearted agreement.But the exchange really got me thinking about the degree of disconnect at play in a reference to the CBS Evening News of a bygone era as part of a serious conversation about contemporary democracy. Yes, there was the obvious problem of assuming that news was ever objective— and here we can cue up a range of critical interventions from the last 50+ years of theory that remind us in a range of less and more drastic tones that we construct reality at least as much as we discover it. And in related spirit, the idea that “America was in good hands in those days” certainly privileges some groups and experiences over others. So as far as solutions go, “Bring Back Walt” is not a very good one.But bad solutions aside, the bigger problem is that the Cronkite Comment misses the very nature of the problem. Deeply so. The biggest problem that new media presents to democracy is not simply that it insulates us in our bubbles, tricks us by way of memetic warfare, and fills us with oodles of misinformation. The biggest problem that new media presents to democracy is that it has already deeply changed us not only at the social level but even at the bio-psychological one. Or to put a finer point on it, it is increasingly turning us into cyborgs — strapped to our devices, yes, but more importantly, finding ourselves processing, feeling, thinking, thriving, seeing, and being in a lot of new ways — even if we prefer to stick to some of the old ways. As for the younger among us, many of them have taken to the new environment like fish to water — even as many of us feel like we’re drowning.Which is why the reference to Great-Grandpa Newsman was not simply off in the way that I am sometimes off when I make a 1989 Simpsons reference to students who were not yet born in that year (“Oh darn; I should have referenced Family Guy,” etc.). Rather, it was off in the much deeper sense of failing to recognize that, for better or worse, social media has not only deeply changed us, but has quite possibly outstripped the very resources of democracy itself. I certainly hope I am wrong about that — but I increasingly worry that I am not.Sarah Pessin teaches philosophy at University of Denver; you can follow her pro-democracy ‘anti-democracy watch’ here; and you can learn more about some of her projects at sarahpessin.com.'], ['Putin mobilises — for a second Tsushima', 'Paul Mason', 'Sep 21', 'https://paulmasonnews.medium.com/putin-mobilises-for-a-second-tsushima-3b8857ced9bc?source=home---------241------------------0----------', 'E\\nvery imperialism has a “style” of failure: America’s retreat in helicopters from Saigon in 1975 echoed 46 years later by the scramble out of Kabul; German expansionism in the 20th century ending twice with the collapse of a dictatorship in Berlin.'], ['Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month As A First-Gen Afro-Dominicano', 'Barney Abramson', 'Oct 13', 'https://momentum.medium.com/celebrating-hispanic-heritage-month-as-a-first-gen-afro-dominicano-50b34c8a62fb?source=home---------67------------------0----------', 'As Hispanic Heritage Month (HMM) comes to a close, I find myself reflecting on my own experience embracing the various ways I can identify and celebrate my heritage in the United…'], ['Middle Seat x John Fetterman: Flipping a U.S. Senate Seat from Red to Blue', 'Middle Seat Consulting', 'Nov 10', 'https://medium.com/@MiddleSeatCo/middle-seat-x-john-fetterman-flipping-a-u-s-senate-seat-from-red-to-blue-b744a13cf26a?source=home---------31------------------0----------', 'Middle Seat was thrilled to join John Fetterman’s campaign for the U.S. Senate from the very beginning. We’re so proud of our team’s hard work to build such a groundbreaking, successful digital program and are so grateful to have been a part of their incredible campaign team.Wayyyyy back in November 2020, Middle Seat officially began working with John Fetterman and senior advisors (like communications expert Rebecca Katz) to begin building a winning grassroots campaign. We worked closely together for two years, from pre-launch planning through prevailing in a crowded primary and on to Election Night victory.Here’s how Middle Seat drove this critical win:John Fetterman had a following from his successful 2018 campaign for Lieutenant Governor, and he grew that following even more after the 2020 election, when he generated a huge amount of earned media by debunking Donald Trump and the GOP’s election denier lies.This was a foundation upon which we could start building a successful U.S. Senate campaign — but it was still only a foundation. So, before the campaign even launched, Middle Seat assembled a comprehensive strategy that spanned web, email, ads, creative, social media, and texting.We took Fetterman’s clean logo and monotone black-and-white color scheme and turned it into a fun & engaging website and brand experience. Our creative team leaned into a bright yellow accent color (inspired by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates, emphasizing Fetterman’s western Pennsylvania roots) and incorporated emojis and strong textures to bring Fetterman’s vibrant personality into the digital world. As we built out more creative collateral through ads, email, social, and web, we brought the witty and gritty tone of the campaign to life on digital.Our goals from the very beginning were to fire up Fetterman’s existing supporters, as well as to recruit new supporters and mobilize them to take action and give on behalf of the campaign. While Fetterman came to the table with a small email list from his prior campaigns, that list hadn’t been regularly engaged with and contained a number of inactive email addresses, as well as out-of-date data. We knew we would need to work hard to revive as much of that list as we could, as well as to scale up rapidly to build a massive new email list that could support a U.S. Senate race likely to garner national attention and fierce opposition.To kick this process off, we planned a soft launch — an exploratory campaign during which we both primed Fetterman’s existing list for the possibility of a Senate run and invested aggressively in acquiring new supporters. We captured data across digital touchpoints so that the campaign could fully harness and extend the power of this growing grassroots army.This early soft launch was not without its challenges — we had to operate in an environment where political campaigns could not launch new ads on Facebook or Google. As a result, our advertising team sprang into action, building out acquisition testing plans that included dozens of sources of new supporters. This approach was effective — within a week of our soft launch, we hit a 128.50% ROI on our initial investments. These strong results proved that our approach was the right one, and that positioned us to make even larger investments in list growth.When launch day came around, not only did we have all of the necessary digital infrastructure in place to set us up for success, we had a comprehensive multi-day launch messaging plan that spanned every single digital platform and property. This meant we could make a big splash early, capturing attention, driving the narrative, and generating huge fundraising returns.Our plan worked — Fetterman raised more than $450,000 in the first 48 hours of his official U.S. Senate campaign launch. Altogether, this early and successful launch quickly established John Fetterman as the front-runner in what would become a crowded Democratic primary.Because open U.S. Senate seats don’t come about very often, we knew that our competition would be fierce. A key part of our strategy was for Fetterman to launch his campaign first — this meant we could start building support, growing his name recognition, locking down endorsements, and raising money before anyone else. By showing our strength at the very beginning of the election cycle, we planned to generate the resources, attention, and enthusiasm that would establish John as the front-runner.Our strategy was effective — and ultimately necessary, considering that our opposition turned out to be formidable. Our primary opponents included a sitting member of Congress and an incumbent Pennsylvania State Representative, among others. Victory was by no means guaranteed, but our strong footing right out of the gate made sure our opposition would have to gain a lot of ground to catch up; locking down supporters and donors early left our opponents with significantly less room in which to maneuver or gain traction.After launch, we kept up a steady drumbeat of multi-channel engagement to drive interest, action, and donations and to keep our launch momentum going long-term. Ultimately, we raised more than $3.5 million online through Q1 of 2021, building a substantial war chest before any of John’s primary opponents had even entered the race.John Fetterman wasn’t a typical candidate, so we knew he couldn’t have a typical digital program.As a result, our team pushed the boundaries of what a candidate could do online, and ensured that every email, ad, tweet, and text sounded like John Fetterman, not a cookie-cutter Democrat. This became our strength — John’s digital program really stood out in the crowded primary field, and it also stood out in the general election among the many, many other Democratic candidates vying for attention and dollars.In an election cycle marked by a deluge of emails boasting fake 1000x matches and high-pressure, the-sky-is-falling messaging, Middle Seat’s team gave a masterclass in how to make digital programs fun and engaging. We aimed for all of our content to be relatable, funny, personable, and accessible — just like John Fetterman himself.We wrote long-form, personal narratives that told the stories of John, his family, his tattoos, and his western Pennsylvania roots, really driving home his personal narrative and message. We ran ads that stayed true to John and his brand. Our email, texting, and ads programs respected John’s supporters as much as he did — meaning no cheap gimmicks or coercive fundraising asks.Even before his candidacy, John built up a well-known online persona that naturally lent to dynamic digital content. As such, we were able to lean fully into signature Jawn-isms, such as Sheetz vs. Wawa battles, content from his wife Gisele and the Fetterkids (who regularly made appearances on digital verticals), and even content voiced by the family’s internet-famous dogs, Levi and Artie. The success of the latter — including booping the dogs’ noses to make a donation, and text messages authored by our favorite dog besties (ilu!!! 💕) — proved that, regardless of what critics on Twitter say, funny and unique content works.Plus, continually emphasizing John’s western Pennsylvania roots really helped the campaign connect with the communities that would become key to his primary and general election victories. And those deep roots and community connections would become even more important in the general election, where we faced off against New Jersey’s own Dr. Oz.We weren’t just successful at raising money or mobilizing voters (though we did plenty of both!), but we also tried new things and ensured every facet of our program reflected John’s personality. We experimented with out-of-the-box ideas, like a weed facts quiz and archival video content to showcase John’s consistency on the issues, from abortion to the minimum wage. We launched Instagram takeovers with members of the campaign staff, like the Horton Brothers, to not only give insight into the enthusiasm of the campaign, but to put a face on those behind the scenes who know John best. We went where other firms wouldn’t — and leaned in even further.For two years, the Middle Seat team collaborated with the Fetterman campaign on a daily basis to raise millions of dollars online, develop authentic content, and persuade and mobilize voters. When Team Fetterman built up their in-house digital team, we coordinated with them to further elevate this program and to achieve even more messaging, mobilization, and fundraising success.In spring of 2022, we launched a multi-million dollar digital advertising campaign to persuade and mobilize primary voters, working closely with TV, mail, and field to ensure a cohesive strategy and message that took advantage of our early lead and John’s unique voice. And then we did it all again in summer for the general, going even bigger with uniquely-targeted programs for key demographics who are often forgotten or taken for granted in election season (after all, standing up for forgotten people and left-behind communities is what John Fetterman does).At the same time, we were engaged by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to run their coordinated digital campaign, which added even more scale to our GOTV efforts. Middle Seat’s in-house video team built out engaging and authentic ads — and we turned around rapid-response ads literally overnight so we could respond to breaking news while it was still fresh.We built one of the largest email lists in modern politics, a robust texting program, and a unified media approach across channels. We ultimately helped Fetterman grow his email list from 54,000 to more than 3 million people. By the end of this campaign, we spent nearly $6 million in email acquisition and over $1 million in phone acquisition to raise back more than $34 million from just those supporters. We maintained overwhelmingly ROI-positive direct donate campaigns to expand our donor base, and we executed clever persuasion and GOTV campaigns that prevailed against the tens of millions of dollars of Dr. Oz’s self-funding, as well as PAC spending from the GOP.We’re incredibly proud to have been part of Team Fetterman from the very beginning and we’re so thankful that John is representing Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate.For more on our work with the Fetterman campaign, stay tuned!

She never returned. She died in the custody of Iran’s morality police, a wing of police that enforces mandatory hijab on Iranian women. Since her death on September 16th, there has been ongoing protest across the country. Mahsa was yet another heartbreaking example that in the Islamic Republic of Iran being a woman is a crime.Mahsa is not the first woman to lose her life simply because they are born a woman in Iran. Countless women have lost their lives Some were victims of honor killing like Mona Heidari, others, died escaping rape like Schiler Rasouli, and others, took their own lives simply because they wanted to watch a football match in the stadium and were not allowed or are jailed to be executed only because they wanted to live their lives as who they are. The list is long.But now Iran is at a turning point in its modern history. Since the disputed presidential election in 2009 (popularly known as the green movement), Iranian society has experienced significant shocks on several fronts: the effects of systemic corruption started to show and as a result, the traditional ecosystem of the regime’s cronies started to change. Some lost their stake in the game and turned into opposition while others moved the wealth they had accumulated to Europe and/or North America. Images of their children on social media indicate that they lead lives that counteract those advocated by their parents for the rest of society. They drink, dance, wear no hejab, mingle with the opposite sex freely, and their lifestyle contradicts the Islamic Republic’s values.At the same time, a growing number of intellectuals have become disillusioned with the reformist agenda and have come to the realization that reform is not possible or meaningful within the framework of a religious dictatorship. They are increasingly aware that the problems with the structure are fundamental, and nothing short of a complete overhaul of the system would bring about real change.Years of mismanagement of natural resources and public funds have resulted in frequent power cuts, lack of access to safe drinking water in some parts of the country, and of course deadly air pollution. In the past few years, every household has felt the combined effects of this failure, corruption, and economic sanctions.The unemployment rate is staggeringly high among educated women. In 2020 nearly 70% of unemployment in the educated population were women. Women occupy almost half the seats in universities. The disproportionately high unemployment rate among women points to structural and cultural discrimination barring women’s access to sustained employment opportunities.Among the less educated segment of society, the dire economic situation has been the driving force behind more recent transformations in the demographics of employment. Jobs that were previously frowned upon for women are now more accepted as many households cannot sustain themselves on one single (usually male) income anymore. As a result, more women have taken up jobs traditionally held by men: women driving trucks or taxis became a common scene. Likewise, the number of women starting and running their home-based businesses has rapidly grown.In today’s Iran, young women are more informed about their basic human rights. Building on the capacities of international Farsi-speaking media and with social media platforms, Iranian activists have circumvented censorship and reached almost all corners of society, spreading information and educational material, and breaking the decade-old barricade that the regime had put in place after the revolution. Women have become more aware of their rights and this time it is not only the highly educated ones.Conversations around women’s rights have become integral to the public discourse in Iran. Campaigns like “the Iranian Me Too” have highlighted and unearthed a diversity of often unpleasant lived experiences of women and the LGBTQ community in Iran, educating men and women alike on the nature, prevalence, and consequences of sexual harassment and gender-based violence.. . Despite heavy backlash from government authorities and the conservatives men and women, the broader population is now more sensitized to women’s rights and gender diversity.In the past four decades, the Islamic Republic has notoriously used smart tactics to deter any network-building and grassroots movements. A large portion of the country’s annual defense budget is allocated to acquiring and maintaining state-of-the-art technology to monitor and control cyberspace and brutally crack down on any opposition. Likewise, the regime has systematically discredited, imprisoned, or killed any potential or emerging opposition leader on the political scene.However, the government will find it more difficult to contain this latest round of protests. Socioeconomic pressure has been felt by many, if not all, strata of the society and it has unintentionally served as a bonding lived experience. The shared pain and pressure coupled with the raised awareness about the utter disregard and regular violation of women’s rights at the legal and societal levels have led to a strong desire for change. When the pressure points are scattered across various communities, provinces, professionals, and all genders clamping down on opposition will prove to be more non-viable every day.Shortly after the tragic killing of Mahsa, on Monday, September 19th, Iranian feminists called for protests in Tehran. Many men and women took to the streets in defiance of compulsory hijab laws. Women now witness the long-awaited solidarity from their fellow citizens.Thanks to Chinese surveillance technology and high-tech CCTV cameras in every city occupying streets has become more dangerous for protestors. The police and intelligence forces can now easily identify and arrest protestors. However, people have learned from the bleak days of a brutal crackdown in the past decade when we all witnessed many innocent lives lost on the streets. Today’s protests are rather different, they demonstrate elements of partisan warfare on three different fronts: streets, social media, and households.Even though there are no official organizers, street protest techniques are visibly more sophisticated. On social media, Iranians who oppose the regime run campaigns to draw international attention to what is going on in Iran. They have been successful in attracting support: as of September 21st, Elon Musk and Anonymous have voiced their support.The regime can, of course, violently stifle protests, ban social media or even run slick campaigns to distract the public but the opposition has now reached households. It is now ever more challenging to counteract what social, political, and women’s rights activists have done to educate the general public. Every move the government makes to close down on public demands will bring more fuel to the fire.Iran’s first and second revolutions were led by men but the third will be led by women which I believe means we are in for a better future. Iranian women are innately compassionate, and years of oppression have taught them to be inclusive. They care about child marriage, as many of them have either been or are closely related to one. They believe in the rights of others because they have experienced how it feels when you take someone’s most basic rights away. And, women seem to have the magic dust of unifying Iran -from every ethnic background and every religious or non-religious group: Arab, Balouch, Azeri, Fars, Lor, Kurd, Sunni, Jews, Baha’i, Zorastrian, Armenian, and much more. They are Iran.The proof is in Mahsa’s case: She is from the Kurdish minority — an ethnic group that has been systematically oppressed for the past four decades, endlessly fighting for its rights, and always dismissed or silenced by the regimes and its supporters. These days, people all over Iran are chanting in support of Kurds. Many, inside and outside Iran, are reverberating a powerful-and universal-demand chanted by the protestors: “Woman, life, freedom”.The female revolution might not happen today or tomorrow. It might not even materialize in the next decade. Who knows how revolutions work… But there is one thing we know: You can only resist change for so long. When women collectively fight for their rights and teach their children to do the same, change becomes inevitable. A look at Iran’s protests and social media bears witness to that and confirms we are on the right path. The next generation is already out there demanding its rights — loud and clear.Read How you can help!'], ['The Three Tech Projects You Meet in Hell', 'Timothy', 'Oct 19', 'https://medium.com/@arthegall/the-three-tech-projects-you-meet-in-hell-2e529132ab3a?source=home---------109------------------0----------', 'If you’ve read even a children’s book about Greek mythology, one thing that will stand out is how often the Greek gods punished people. Whether you were mortal or immortal, if you broke a promise or snubbed a guest or showed even the smallest amount of hubris in front of an Olympian, you could end up spending eternity as a spider, or tied to a flaming wheel, or as a frustrated futurist.Of course, ancient myth isn’t just an easy source of bedtime stories for 21st century children (another: a good translation of Grimm). It also can work for us the same way it worked for the ancient Greeks themselves: a reasonable store of metaphor, archetypes, and shorthand for people or situations we meet or know in every day life.Three of the most famous, and vivid, punishment myths are the myths of Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Prometheus.It occurred to me recently — during a conversation with a coworker, another software engineer at an ‘enterprise’ (i.e. large) company — that while we always want to see ourselves directly in the roles of mythical characters, these three myths actually function as good metaphors for different kinds of technical teams we are likely to encounter during a career.I’m not talking about successful teams here! These are punishment myths, and so the kind of team or project that I’d like to describe are failing or broken.I’ll argue that there are three kinds of Broken Team or Failing Project, which we can describe as(I’ll use “Team” and “Project” nearly interchangeably for the rest of this post.)Knowing what kind of team you’re in — or maybe what kind of team you’re dealing with from the outside — might be helpful in understanding how to talk to the people in it, predicting how it will (nearly inevitably) end, and perhaps softening the blow for those involved with it when it does.Each kind of team I’m describing differs in the way it’s perceived from the inside of the team (by members of the team or project, or close coworkers) vs the outside of the team (usually “management”).We sometimes find Sisyphus teams in organizations where groups of engineers are allocated (sometimes in a “matrix”) across multiple products or projects. Each product team conducts meetings, does planning, closes tickets, executes releases — and yet the team itself is unmoored from the users who do (or don’t) use their software, and “floats” in a state of keeping-the-lights-on water-treading for years at a time. A manager might look at project planning software and see that “we have 15% of engineer A and 23% of engineer B allocated to the team,” but … nothing is really happening.So a Sisyphus team, from the outside, looks like it’s making progress. Engineers are assigned, tickets are being closed, code is committed, the rock is being rolled up that hill! Sure, there might be occasional setbacks or problems, but the team is functioning and day-to-day or week-to-week there are incremental improvements.From the inside, however, a Sisyphus team’s difficulty in reaching its goals — its futility and absurdity — are immediately apparent. This is not to say that the members of the team are necessarily frustrated. They might be unhappy, but sometimes they have come to grips with the absurdity of their own situation and the consequent freedom bought by that realization.Tantalus teams are, if anything, the mirror image of Sisyphus teams.From inside, the team always appears about to reach its goals. Project completion, or the next release, is always close. People in the team are hungry, motivated… and it’s only from the outside that perhaps we can see how the deadlines are always receding, the “killer” feature always delayed, the important customer always a little unsatisfied.Examples of a Tantalus team might be a team that’s trying to build, internally, a product or migration that will solve all our problems. Perhaps this team uses words like platform or framework to describe their end goal. It’s the last heist before retirement, or the “MVP” that doesn’t turn out to be so “minimal.”But however you describe it, the work is always in the present while the rewards continue to hover in the future.Another dividing line between Sisyphus and Tantalus teams is understanding how they end. How does an organization bring itself to a point where it can shut down a Broken Team, or end a Failed Project?Each of these teams is broken through the way that the inside and outside views of the team are so different, and so any resolution will necessary also involve re-aligning these two viewpoints.The distinction between inside and outside perceptions of a team points us towards one answer: Sisyphus teams are ended through ground-up communication, while Tantalus teams must be shut down by management.In the case of a Sisyphus team, change has to come from team level up to management, about the state of the project, its lack of progress, and the futility and frustration that results from continued work.Conversely, in a Tantalus team, you can’t make progress by talking to the team members. Here, each person working on the project still believes that they’re always almost about to reach their goal! It’s the responsibility of the gods, the Olympian C-Suite or upper management, to realize that Tantalus is grasping at but never reaching its own goals.The alternative to successfully shutting down a Sisyphus or Tantalus team is that it becomes the third kind of failure: a Prometheus team.Prometheus had perhaps the most straightforward punishment. There’s no difference-of-opinion about what is happening to him: he’s getting his liver eaten. He knows, the vultures who eat it know, the gods know. Everyone knows, and yet the punishment continues.Maybe you’ve encountered this kind of project in your own career. Perhaps it’s a piece of critical infrastructure which only one engineer knows how to maintain and therefore can never escape. Or it might be an application, so crusted over with technical debt and unused code that updating or releasing it is impossible, but which has a user group powerful enough to prevent any tech retirement or migration.This is the third kind of Broken Team: a team which is clearly dysfunctional, yet no one involved has the will or power to fix. From management who fund its, to the leaders who run it, and even the engineers who are tormented by it daily, everyone knows it’s broken but we are hopelessly chained to the rock.You’ll sometimes hear engineers involved in startups or small companies claim that the biggest mistake is building the wrong software, that “knowing what to build” is the most important thing.In a large company, by contrast, “knowing what teams to shut down” is one of the most important decisions an organization can make. The alternative is broken teams which continue to push on for years at a time, always almost successful, or forever pushing the tickets up the hill while watching new ones slide back down to the bottom.When you find (or find yourself in) a Sisyphus or Tantalus team, you also have a decent guess as to what kind of feedback is needed — and from whom — before the team can be shut down. Even Prometheus was eventually rescued from his rock.Don’t let your teams become Prometheus Teams! If you’re a manager, find your Tantalus projects. If you’re an engineer in a Sisyphus team, speak up! Prometheus may be objectively the best Titan (insert [fire emoji] [human emoji] here) but no one deserves that kind of punishment.'], ['How We Recreated the Dixie Wildfire’s Plume from Radar and Satellite Data', 'The NYT Open Team', 'Oct 29', 'https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-recreated-the-dixie-wildfires-plume-from-radar-and-satellite-data-d6e829a727cd?source=home---------78------------------0----------', 'By Nick BartzokasIn mid-July, 2021, the Dixie fire ignited in California. Days later, it began to exhibit an increasingly common and concerning behavior. It created its own weather, producing storm clouds, winds, and lightning. In October of that year, The New York Times published a visual recreation of the fire’s activity.This coverage took a team of diverse talents. This article highlights the technical work, specifically that of Evan Grothjan, Daniel Mangosing, Scott Reinhard and myself. To learn more about the inspiration and reporting that went into this piece, check out this Times Insider article for some perspective from our teammates Noah Pisner, Nadja Popovich, and Karthik Patanjali.Neil Lareau, an atmospheric scientist who studies wildfires, advised us on this project. He popularized a technique for creating 3D animations of wildfire plumes from radar data. We decided to adapt that technique for an interactive web article and an AR story on Instagram. Our newsroom’s graphics editors in collaboration with software engineers in R&D assembled radar, satellite, and other weather data into an animated, 3D illustration giving readers an up-close look at the phenomenon of fire-driven weather. Here’s a flythrough of the final result.Let’s first focus on the ground level datasets we used: terrain color and height, the position and timing of lightning strikes, and the coverage of the fire itself. The scientific software community provides a wealth of open source tools we can use to work with these types of data.For the California terrain that sits below our smoke plume, we gathered high resolution (10 meter) imagery from the Sentinel 2 satellite’s L1C product using the sentinelhub-py library which lets you specify a range of dates to composite together into a cloudless image of the Earth’s surface. To add a height dimension, we retrieved a grayscale digital elevation model (DEM) from 3DEP using the py3dep library, as this example demonstrates.We received lightning strike data from Vaisala, a company that monitors global weather and environmental conditions. Using geopandas, we generated an image sequence indicating the locations where lightning struck the ground as small dots. Evan Grothjan aligned these reference images to the terrain in his scene, designed realistic lightning bolts, and positioned them above each of the dots.Scott Reinhard worked on one of the most crucial components, a visual representation of the fire spreading over the land. He sourced burn area and intensity data from GOES and VIIRS, and perimeter data from CalFIRE. Using gdal and other tools, he created an animation of the fire’s intensity and behavior on the ground.After laying the groundwork for the plume visualization, Scott developed the visual language and iconography used to call attention to the plume’s behaviors, and mapped the extent of the fire in a 2D graphic later in the article.Having constructed the ground-level part of our scene, we now turn our attention to visualizing the fire’s plume in 3D. Data for this visualization came from three NEXRAD radar stations in California and Nevada. Each recorded the Dixie fire’s activity roughly every 10 minutes. We previewed and selected datasets using NOAA’s Weather and Climate Toolkit (WCT).Radar stations emit pulses of radio waves and observe what gets reflected back. Denser stuff in the air, like water droplets in clouds and large ash particles in smoke plumes, reflect the radar pulse more powerfully. The power of the returning signal, called “reflectivity”, approximates the density of airborne matter. The time it takes for the reflection to return indicates the distance of that substance. The radar makes many such observations, sweeping 360 degrees for several vertical angles.As we began to assemble data for this project, we didn’t know what area and what times to visualize. And since the fire was ongoing, we needed quick access to up-to-date data in 3D. To solve these problems, we created an automated pipeline allowing us to specify a date range and map region and quickly preview what the plume looked like then and there. As the project evolved, we added steps to process and refine the data, focusing on features that were central to the story. Fast transformations from data to visuals enabled us to pivot quickly when new examples of relevant behavior happened in real time. Here’s how we built that pipeline.NOAA hosts its NEXRAD data online where we retrieved it using the Siphon library. We then used Py-ART, a powerful python tool for working with radar observations, to merge the datasets of multiple radar stations, conform them to a regular cartesian grid, and apply spatial interpolation with algorithms tailored to the nuances of radar data. Already, we were able to quickly visualize 3D atmospheric data from any time and space observed by NEXRAD.To target a time range for our story, we periodically rendered a low resolution timelapse of the entire dataset. This way we could quickly scan hundreds of hours of data and hone in on particularly active days. As we looked closer at the most eventful time periods, we found that all of the key behaviors of interest to the story occurred on July 19 between 11:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m, Pacific Daylight Time.With the data selected and normalized, our next task was to export files for our graphics artists to animate. NEXRAD data is stored as NetCDF files. This format encodes multi-dimensional datasets flexibly and is commonly used across many scientific disciplines. However, we needed this data in a format compatible with CG software. For that we used OpenVDB. It is widely compatible and has its own python library. We exported our radar data as a time-series of OpenVDB volumes, and brought them into Houdini.Airborne material may reflect radar beams, but that doesn’t guarantee it will be visible to the naked eye. Reflectivity isn’t the same as visible opacity. So we needed to find an appropriate reflectivity threshold that would define the edges of Dixie’s plume. Thankfully, Alert Wildfire recorded time lapse footage of Dixie. By comparing this footage with our renders side-by-side, we ensured that we were representing the visible plume as faithfully as possible.From time to time we needed to render the data in a new way so that a characteristic could be observed visually. For example, the maximum height of the fire plume was an important point discussed in the story. We acquired the height observed in the field from our interviews with experts and wanted to find that moment in our data. Since there is noise in radar data, a simple max of the sample values would not suffice as it might pick up one of the noisy pops. Instead, we rendered an orthographic visual test to spot the plume’s highest moment.Since our data had passed through a number of processing steps, when it arrived in Houdini, we wanted to check the integrity of the entire dataset, even the interior which was never shown in the article’s graphics. We rendered nested isosurfaces to check that the plume’s core remained intact and matched the expectations of our collaborating scientists.Our layers of data were all combined in Houdini for further production and needed to be aligned exactly. GIS software understands geospatial data and projections, but most CG apps and formats do not. To ensure accurate alignment, all outputs from python conformed to a common projection and bounding box. That meant that aligning layers in Houdini was as easy as snapping their edges. We rendered top-down orthographic tests to confirm that all our data layers lined up properly.At this point, our plume visualization was detailed enough to demonstrate the large-scale behaviors central to the article but they lacked surface detail, small-scale undulations without which the plume appeared deceptively small and calm.Referencing time lapse footage, Daniel Mangosing used Houdini’s Cloud Noise and Volume Wrangle nodes to churn the surface and give our illustration an appropriate sense of scale and activity. This work was done carefully, however, as we did not want to affect any of the large-scale behaviors on which we relied for the story. So while he developed the look of these noise patterns, he tested them on smooth blimp-like shapes, making sure the new undulations remained minor, in a shallow layer on the surface.As mentioned earlier, NEXRAD radar stations record observations roughly every 10 minutes. But a fire plume changes much faster than that. In order to create a smooth animation through time, we needed to improve our temporal resolution. For this step Daniel used Houdini’s Retime node which can interpolate in-between frames for volumes.Finally, Evan Grothjan and Scott Reinhard developed the look of our final renders. Our goal was to signal to the reader that this is a representation of the event, but not the event itself. Removing the sky was one simple but effective way to do this. Using Cinema 4D and the Redshift renderer, Evan tweaked the plume’s color and material properties, scene lighting, camera work and rendering. Evan and Scott explored a number of visual effects in the scene, ultimately selecting a design that balanced our visual priorities: clarity where our visuals supported the story, and an aesthetic that evoked scientific illustration.Here again is the full animation from the article.In addition to our coverage on the web and in our app, we published an augmented reality experience on Instagram using the Spark AR platform. This presented a unique challenge. For our web article, we rendered a video through which a reader progresses by scrolling. In AR, the user is free to look at the plume from any angle, so we couldn’t pre-render the content. It had to be rendered in real-time on the mobile device. That would prove difficult since Spark effects are limited to 4 MB, and the platform doesn’t support rendering volumes yet. Luckily these are problems that graphics programmers have had to solve before. In fact we had already used a time-tested technique, rendering a volume as slices, in our work visualizing volumetric data for the article Why Opening Windows Is a Key to Reopening Schools and its accompanying augmented reality experience.To get Houdini VDBs into AR, we used a process analogous to medical CT scanning. We captured many cross sections of the plume and exported those slices as sprite sheets using the Volume Texture Export node. We also generated geometry on which to render that imagery, a stack of planes. With enough slices tightly packed together, the gaps aren’t noticeable. The layers combine together to create what looks like a solid volume.CG software renders volumes in a rich environment of lighting and reflections. Converting volumes to a stack of cards rules out the option of natural lighting. Luckily, Houdini provides a way to bake the effects of lighting into the color of a volume, effectively rendering lighting effects before the export, using the Bake Volume node. Using this node, we baked in sunlight, shadows, and a red glow from the underlying fire.With our fire plume rendered in augmented reality as a stack of cards, some creative options opened up to us. We could reveal the plume from top to bottom in an animation sequence and tint a subset of slices to draw attention to which layers of atmosphere they occupied. These ended up being useful devices for storytelling in AR.This project is one of many efforts to visualize 3D data sets. Some of the techniques developed in our coverage of the Dixie fire helped us tell the story of The Chain of Failures That Left 17 Dead in a Bronx Apartment Fire. Our work visualizing data continues in the hope that insights drawn from these graphics will help our readers and the world make better, more informed decisions in the future.Nick Bartzokas is an R&D Engineer at The New York Times.

People get visibly uncomfortable. They clam up and offer condolences, and then pretend that you didn’t mention it at all. They don’t ask any more questions.I always get this way in the days leading up to November. Every year, things start to fray. Getting out of bed becomes an accomplishment for a little while.This year was a perfect storm. I’ve been courting burnout for most of 2015. I had to stare into the mirror and tell myself that I believe in what I’m doing, that I can handle any workload without complaint.But the grief never disappated. It only appeared less frequently and less acutely until everything became a reminder again.It’s easy to say someone died. It’s much harder to say, “I think I’m having a nervous breakdown.”I’m sitting in half of a treehouse. It’s the middle of the night. The pine needles above me are blocking out the moon and the stars, and the laptop glow is the only source of light. I’m messaging my best friend Kat and trying to explain why I ran away to Wisconsin.My youngest brother Grant brought me here today, to the ruins of a fort that I built in the woods long ago. In junior high I found four sturdy trees that formed a rectangle and nailed a few old barnwood slats between them. It didn’t have a roof or a door and I certainly hadn’t exercised any technical skill while putting it together. It was a crummy little fort, a few boards nailed to a few trees. It was nothing special. But I had imagination to spare, and sometimes all I needed was space.It crumbled over the years. A few of the wooden planks fell off or were blown off in a storm or got kicked off by my brother Jesse and me and our friends while we played paintball in these woods.Jesse would have smiled if he knew that we came out here today. It’s been almost ten years to the day since I crawled into his hospital bed and sang him to sleep, and I feel it in every moment of every November day.No matter what a million people will tell you about “how to help someone grieve,” there’s not a whole lot you can really do if you haven’t been there. It’s something you should be grateful to misunderstand.Funny. I never realized it, but now Kat and I both have dark days next to each other on the calendar. She lost her mother a year ago to a vicious cosmic joke, a rare disease. Now I spend a lot of late nights telling her again and again: I know. I know.It feels like we’re the only ones who understand this cavernous empty space on the calendar. She will never ask why I’m crying over a date.I fill her fridge on the right days and respond to thousands of text messages and prove that I’m the one person who will never call her crazy. And she does the same for me. I’m trying to help her the only way I know how, by reliving it alongside her. Even though her grief is fresh and mine is a decade old, we both understand and recognize the pieces of it that we share.This is the only thing that helps. It’s a collection of connections, a million little unspoken everyday actions. We share them between us and with the people we lost. They help us understand how tiny things can reverberate, how people can change each other in silence.That’s why I’m here, at home, in the woods, in the trees. I needed to show up. For the family I have left.Dad met us out here in the woods earlier. He drove the big white truck that he drives everywhere, with every imaginable tool stashed away in the boxes in the back. He pulled a trailer full of brand new lumber, and parked it at the edge of the trees.I hid in the ruined fort, behind a pallet and a few barnwood slats still stuck to the trees, and pelted him with pinecones when he came close. He screamed, gruffly, and sunk into a defensive stance, but his face bloomed and his yell turned to laughter once he realized that I was home. He wrapped me in a bear hug, a little longer than usual — a few seconds spoke volumes.I was home for a full day before I saw my dad. He’d been living away from home for a while, fighting to keep our future Thanksgivings from finally, legally, breaking in two.I wanted to tell my dad that I understood. Whether you spend 30 years or three planning a life together, nobody wants to watch it crumble. It was gnawing away at me too.My dad and I don’t talk about my relationships very often — I’m always waiting for him to ask. My last boyfriend isn’t anything like my mom, and our relationship wasn’t anything like my parents’. But I thought we were headed for 30 years, until a month ago.He wrote an album about me, full of our story in every note. He isn’t the first guy to write something about me (I’ve racked up an embarrassing yet flattering collection of self-aggrandizing Buzzfeed essays and sweet books about boys kissing boys) but he made us into music and it reverberated in my bones. It felt like something we made together, even though he did all the work and I only named a song or two. While he was working on the album, he sent me early versions of his songs, and I could turn them on and let them sing me to sleep.I bought a ring, with my fingerprint engraved on the inside. I rehearsed a thousand times in my head giving it to him and telling him: no matter how far away you are, you will always have my hand in yours.It took me three years, but I finally rearranged the messiness of my heart to leave him an open drawer or two. We had hopped back and forth every few months from Paris to New York in an exhausting international tango, driven by jejune hope, and I was ready.That crazy bit of hope was everything, and it disappeared around the same time that the album came out. While I was planning my proposal and talking gleefully about moving to Paris, we fell apart. The silence spoke louder than any songs.I don’t resent him; I only blame myself. In retrospect, it was insane. And I can finally stop curling up with an empty pillow and calling it love.I brought the ring home with me. I wasn’t sure what to do with it, besides fiddle with it in my pocket. I can’t sell it with my fingerprint on it, and it will never belong to anyone but him.I had it when Dad and Grant and I started in on the treehouse. I would occasionally reach in my pocket for another screw, and my finger would find it, and I would think about flinging it away, but I wouldn’t.We raised a new foundation with a couple of hefty 2x8s. We screwed the boards into each other, into the trees, into supports.My dad gave each of us a job: Grant measured and marked the skeleton of the new floor, I attached supports using heavy-duty screws, and my dad measured planks and slotted them into their places. Then, together, we nailed down plywood on top.I kept wondering why we didn’t knock the old barnwood off the trees. But I followed Grant’s marks, using the electric drill to drive each support into the foundation. It was useful, at least, to be able to climb on the boards as the treehouse above us took shape.My phone was buzzing incessantly. I kept trying to ignore it. My head screamed at me to at least try and detox from notifications, but a few times I couldn’t help myself. I put down my drill and slipped out my phone. Forty breaking news alerts, 142 emails, and 12 messages from Kat.It’s okay to put them away for a few days, I told myself, over and over again, like an addict with a mantra. I felt guilty with every unanswered work email, like each one was a hungry child with sad eyes and my phone was Sally Struthers.I love where I work — it’s exciting, I think we’re creating the future and making a difference. But I work at a startup and I have no idea how to manage my own stress levels. I never figured out what balance looks like, and I ran myself into the ground.Why is that a hard thing to admit? I have no idea what work-life balance looks like. There. Why did I have to invent a funeral before hitting the eject button? Am I off the leaderboard now? Is this another obnoxious story about why I left New York, only written a few weeks too soon?I don’t think so. But I’m building a life, or trying to, and everything is still up in the air.It was really the messages from Kat that I was looking for. I knew these days were tough for her too, and I knew she needed me to be there. Once I responded, I listened to the flight attendant in my head and put the oxygen mask over my own face first. I turned off my phone.By the time we finished the foundation, the sun was riding low in the sky. Grant and I had to leave — we promised to join my little sisters for a game of ultimate Frisbee. Dad wanted to stay behind and keep working, like always. We shot off on the four-wheeler and left him behind in the trees, quietly building something for us. Just him and his work, building his ideal future, the way he’s always done. That’s his one true love.I envy him that.At dinner, my mom asked a question:“You wouldn’t care if we didn’t have that house anymore, would you?”I changed the subject. A few minutes later I walked to the bathroom, stood over the toilet and retched. When nothing came out I sat down, put my head in my hands, and cried.The old drafty farmhouse next to the fort in the woods is everything I have ever had, everything that I remember. Without it I have no real home, no anchor, no recollections, no past. It’s what my parents built together, everything we have ever been.It turns out I did come back for a funeral, of sorts.My dad didn’t do much after we left. The sun only gave him an hour more. But now there’s a real floor for a brand new treehouse floating in the branches.I crawled up onto the plywood, kicking bits of the old boards off the trees when they wouldn’t hold my weight.I came back tonight to sit in this thing that we built, to look into the pine needles by the glow of my laptop and use the silence to try to be honest. Maybe I’ll leave the ring out here, nailed into a secret spot under the floorboards. Maybe I’ll try to talk to Jesse again. Maybe I’ll text Kat and tell her I love her.It is possible, I tell myself, to build a new foundation.I hope this time it will hold.'], ['Liberation and Power as a Black Writer', 'Carvell Wallace', 'Nov 1', 'https://momentum.medium.com/liberation-and-power-as-a-black-writer-b861509b9f50?source=home---------37------------------0----------', 'The older I get the more I am convinced that my ancestors speak through me.

I was ambitious — I wanted to be a part of something big. I wanted to be able to support myself financially and not worry my parents (as this was a high bar set at doctor, aka the “stablest of all professions,” I suspect they still secretly worry about this.) I wanted the kind of job where I wouldn’t be watching the clock every hour, daydreaming like Rebecca Black about Friday.But beyond that, the specifics of “thinking about my career” was a giant grey cloud to me. It felt almost icky to be too career-oriented, like if you were, you were that kind of self-absorbed person constantly trying to game the system by sugar-coating the things you said to your bosses. Besides, at 22, I had taken my first job at a start-up where we were moving way too fast to sit down and idly contemplate the skills we hoped to learn. Who needs career conversations when you’re busy changing the world?Here’s the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not. If you don’t think about it, then you’re putting faith in the winds. Maybe you’ll end up somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Maybe not. Why take that chance when you can captain your own sails?Here’s what I wish I had known about getting a handle on my career earlier in life:It’s common to think of your career as your level within the company, or how much money you make, or your title, or whether you were included in some prestigious group (a meeting of importance, an exclusive conference, a list of N under N, an award recipient, etc.)Often, I hear people say things like, “I’m interested in advancing my career. What do I need to do to get promoted?”This is a perfectly valid question to ask, but I suspect what lurks beneath the question is the assumption that advancing one’s career = getting a promotion. I contest this quite heavily. In my opinion, it’s like equating being a good friend with getting invited to friend’s wedding.Certainly, the people who attend someone’s wedding are likely to be good friends. But you wouldn’t think that optimizing for getting an invitation to a wedding is the right way to go about being a good friend. In fact, it’s entirely the other way around. If you focus 100% on being a great friend to someone, even if you never once thought about being invited to their wedding, guess what. You’re probably going to get that fancy envelope in the mail.The same is true regarding your career. If you focus exclusively on improving your skills and your impact to your organization (or to the world at large), the promotions, raises and accolades tend to come as a byproduct.The reverse isn’t true. As an extreme analogy, you might have a terrible boss who tells you the way to get a promotion is to shut your mouth, fetch her coffee every morning, and do any busywork she assigns you. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Cool. But would doing this actually help you in the long run? Would doing this teach you new skills and make you a more attractive hire for some other company down the line? Probably not. Maybe what happens is that you rise in the ranks of that company only to have it go bankrupt later on. (Hey, this isn’t unreasonable given the organization seems to possess questionable management practices). Post-bankruptcy, you realize you don’t have many marketable skills in this rapidly-changing economy, so it’s hard to get a job at a similar comfort level to what you had. Life sucks. You get bitter.So don’t ask “What does it take to get a promotion?” Ask instead: “How can I be doing more to help make our customers (or would-be customers) happy?” Ask “What skills should I be developing to help me increase my impact?”Even if your current company has a broken promotion system, even if your company collapses tomorrow due to the winds of ill fortune, even if every external measure you hold yourself to — title, salary, affiliation, awards — goes out the window, your skills are forever. Nobody can take those away from you. No matter where you journey, your skills and your past experiences go along for the ride. This is why you shouldn’t worry too much if your career doesn’t follow some up-and-up external ladder structure. Are there instances where a new role with a pay cut and a title downgrade might unlock a treasure trove of new learnings and opportunities? Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? Just ask Sheryl Sandberg.Careers are long, so invest into them where it counts.For most of my career, I had the mental model that my manager, like my teachers and professors of the past, was someone in a position of authority who took note of what I did and passed judgement on it. They determined whether I was or wasn’t doing well, what I needed more critical feedback on, and what letter grade or assessment I deserved.As such, my modus operandi for interacting with my manager could be summarized in one neat statement: don’t come across as an idiot.This meant that I’d try and act as if I had my shit together in front of him or her. I’d exude confidence and optimism, even when I wasn’t feeling it. I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. There was no clearer evidence of personal failure than if my manager had to get involved in something I was responsible for. I read it as a neon sign brightly flashing Warning: employee not competent enough to take care of this task on her own.It wasn’t until I had managed for many years myself that this mindset began to change.Look, your manager’s job (assuming she is a good manager) is to help you and the rest of your team get better results. From this perspective, it is completely logical that she should be invested in your career. When you do better, then by extension, she does better. Hence, your manager is someone who is on your side, who wants you to succeed, and who is willing to spend a good deal of time and energy to help you do that.Can you imagine a star athlete trying to hide their weaknesses in front of their coach? Would you tell your personal trainer, “Oh, I’m pretty fit, I’ve got it under control” when she asks you how she can help you achieve a better workout? Of course not. That is not how a coaching relationship works.It’s precisely because I didn’t see my manager as a coach that I missed out on years of asking for and receiving training and feedback that would have helped me become better faster. Yes, of course, your manager still plays the role of judge. Yes, she can (and should) fire you if you can’t do the job, or do nothing but play Pokemon Go all day. But assuming you’re not unqualified or lazy or an asshole (and trust me, if you were, you’d know quite quickly), then your manager would like nothing better than for your career to be on a rocket-ship trajectory to the moon.You don’t just need coaching when you’re struggling. I’m willing to bet that everyone who’ll take home gold at Rio will have a coach. A majority of them will probably credit good coaching as a critical factor in getting them to where they are.The more honest you can be with your manager about your aspirations, your motivations, and where you’d like their help to improve, the faster you’ll move.A few years back, I wrote about a little book that caught my eye at Safeway, an obnoxious little thing with faux wax seal, quill-pen script, the ancient parchment paper glowing as if with magical beams. The book loudly proclaimed: Get whatever you want. Discover the secret to life.Spoiler warning ahead, but this is what the secret to getting whatever you want turned out to be: if you believe it can happen, it will happen.(I know, I know. I too was hoping it would be something more along the lines of Burn a sprig of Douglas Fir at 11:23pm on the eve of the New Moon and bow three times to a fat armadillo.)As trivial as the new-age tidbit of if you can believe it can happen, it will happen sounds, there is research that shows if you can create a clear visualization of yourself achieving the outcome you want, you prime yourself to act in a way that is consistent with what you imagine.Many years ago, when I was frustrated by all the things I struggled with and felt unequipped or scared to do in my job, I started a list of what I wished a future me would one day be able to waltz in and easily accomplish. This list is titled One Day, I will…Now, maybe seven or eight years later, this list is still up-to-date. I’ve added additional items throughout the years, but the more incredible thing is how I’ve been able to check things off. The skills that once seemed a distant dream when I was 25 or 26 now feel like second nature. And these proof points give me confidence that all the new items I am still adding will also happen. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.Going back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. These things I can clearly visualize are totally doable. So do them I will.If you’re curious what my list looks like, here is a snippet of items checked off through the years, and items that I am still working on:One Day, I will……✓ Not feel intimidated when I interview someone because I’m worried about what they think of me as an interviewer.✓ Not be nervous about a public speaking event in the days before it happens.✓ Feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting of > 5.✓ Publicly blog without stressing about what other people will think.Succinctly and clearly be able to make the point I want to make in 3 bullets.Regularly be able to weave compelling stories and analogies into verbal explanations.Host large events where people have fun and I am not really stressed out.…This is the last takeaway because no matter how many people are on the sidelines helping you, ignoring you, or working against you, your career — like your life — is your responsibility. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want. All of these things are in your power to affect or change.If you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why.If you look back on your last six months and you can’t point to anything that’s been hard for you, question whether you are challenging yourself enough.If you find yourself constantly looking for other people to tell you how awesome you’re doing, consider if you’re shortchanging your own growth and development.If your manager is not giving you the support or coaching you’d like, tell her how you’d like to be supported or coached.If working at your current company is not aligned with your long-term goals or values, consider making a move.If you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.No matter which way the wind blows, I hope you make it to beautiful shores.Interested in asking a question or following along for more advice?

Some success in doubles in his home country Australia, beset by injuries, a likely transition to coaching on the cards. He’d been in Switzerland full time for four years when he first saw a shy nine-year-old kid hitting tennis balls at a club in Basel. At one of the sessions, the kid’s mother brought him to Carter.“This is Roger,” she said.Over the years that followed, Peter often spoke to his old doubles partner, Darren Cahill. Cahill would rave about this Australian kid he was training, Lleyton Hewitt. Peter would respond with stories about his own protégé. Peter would even call his parents back in Australia. He’d tell them about the “gigantic talent” he had on his hands.This boy Roger, by most accounts, wasn’t even the best in his own age group at the time. Peter didn’t mind. He looked at Roger with foresight, to draw out from the young boy what he could be. He had the mind for the series of assumptions and richness of imagination needed to bring that vision to life. Peter wasn’t Roger’s first coach, nor was he the coach under whom Roger became famous. But he was, as Roger himself has emphasised to anyone who will listen, his real coach.For twenty-four years, millions around the world have had countless opportunities to give thanks to Peter Carter.T\\nhrough the most critical years of Roger’s development as a young prospect, Peter constructed the technical platform on which his blistering natural talent could thrive. The moving picture in our collective mind’s eye of how Roger moves across a tennis court, how he steps into a ball before striking it, the product of resistance that is his one-handed backhand, his sharpened sense of anticipation, his vast knowledge of what decision to make when and why. They’re all best understood as decorations to the house that Peter built.Further, Peter’s platform gave young Roger the superiority he often needed over his opponents so that his own destructive, hot-headed side derailed him less often. As he grew older, he grasped that he could just be better than his opponents; that he didn’t need to get agitated while playing. That emotional runoff area — the space during a tennis match to master his emotions — is something that Peter constructed. Peter both designed what we now intuitively recognise as the Roger Federer aesthetic and meticulously wrapped the emotional touchpaper capable of setting it alight in a cling film of calmness. Many have since laid claim to spotting the genius in Federer, but Peter was the very first. He was able to bring Federer’s gift to the world because he was blessed with a gift of his own.Peter Carter watched a young Roger Federer and somehow intuited that it’s not what you look at that matters — it’s what you see.C\\noming up through the ranks, the knock on Roger Federer sometimes was that he didn’t hold his own enough.He often played up to the high level of top opponents but, just as frequently, played down to the level of opponents he should’ve been beating. It’s well and good to have your vision of how to play tennis but, at that specific time, Federer didn’t have a consistent route to overcome big servers on fast courts or powerful sluggers on slower ones.He’s always great to watch, went the criticism back then, but if he doesn’t win enough, no one will watch him.At Wimbledon in 2001, the Federer pieces finally started to lock into place. In the fourth round, he faced Pete Sampras: seven-time Wimbledon champion, Grand Slam king, matter-of-factly the best men’s singles player of the 1990s and, in a matter of no small personal significance, a boyhood idol of Federer’s. They played for three hours and forty-one minutes, long into the London evening.“Sometimes it was weird, I looked on the other side of the net, I saw him,” recalled Federer later. “Sometimes I was like, it’s true, this is happening now, I’m playing against him.”Speaking to the perceptible shift in his mindset, he continued, “But then it just goes away, this feeling. You think about your serve, where you’re going to go, then it’s like playing against some other player.”At 5–6 in the final set, on Sampras’ serve, Federer hit two shots I won’t soon forget.The first was a backhand return winner for 0–15. Federer read the serve, watched it onto his backhand, and cracked it, right in the sweet part of his range, at about 80% extension, and sent it fast and hard to the right of the onrushing Sampras. The second was a forehand return winner at 15–40, holding two match points. This time, he read the serve even better, sorted his feet out well before the ball got to him, and laced the ball over the high part of the net, past the service box, deep into the backhand corner to the onrushing Sampras’ left.Now, I don’t suppose anyone thinks Federer is the best returner of a serve to have ever lived. Nor does anyone hold him principally culpable for the demise of serve and volley. At the same time, to anyone who grew up watching tennis around Sampras-Federer 2001, both propositions wear a cloak of legitimacy. They’re right there, undeniable, on video. At the sharpest end of the fifth set on the night the ship of the seven-time champion passed the ship of the to-be eight-time champion on the Wimbledon high seas, Federer shook Sampras with a backhand return of serve that connected so clean that it forced him to serve to the forehand, and then beat him with a forehand return so good that getting to it from a commitment to forward motion was out of the question.You know, Federer seemed to be saying, you really shouldn’t serve and come straight to the net.It was the first time Sampras had lost a five-setter at Wimbledon. It was uncannily evocative of Sampras’ own coming to the dance moment, a five-set quarterfinal win as a nineteen-year-old over Ivan Lendl at the 1990 US Open. This was twelve years on, a five-set, fourth round win for the nineteen-year-old Federer.Federer-Sampras 2001 felt like a generational handoff, a hinge in the history of the game.F\\nederer lost to Tim Henman in the very next round.All the same, he was now strapped with the burden of conquering Sampras, like a target on his back. Nowhere was this more apparent than at Wimbledon the following year. Despite being seeded seventh, a lot of punters had him, at the age of twenty-one, to win the whole thing.He crashed and burned in the first round, in a 6–3, 7–6², 6–3 thrashing by qualifier Mario Ančić. As soon as it happened, those early doubters were all over him again.He can’t beat big servers. He can’t handle the pressure.This boy Roger, he’s too emotional.T\\nhe grind of the ATP Tour, however, is relentless.Federer was soon in Canada for the Toronto Masters. As he was preparing for the tournament, he got a call.Peter Carter, he was told, had been killed in a road accident while on holiday in South Africa.It was as if a record needle was suddenly, angrily scratching and tearing across the surface of his life. Federer staggered out of his hotel room and onto the street, crying and inconsolable. It’s hard to process something like that, leave alone get over it. Carter hadn’t just been a foundational figure, he’d been snatched away in a manner that left everyone reeling in shock and disorientation.Federer played on in Toronto. He lost in the first round.He went to Cincinnati the next week, and lost in the first round.He went to Long Island a couple of weeks later, and lost in the first round again.Peter’s funeral was the first one Roger ever went to. It was a chance to say goodbye but, as Roger breaking down when speaking about Peter as recently as 2019 betrayed, that wound will never fully heal.At the time, the jolt threatened to derail his career.The cling film of calmness that Peter had so tightly wrapped around Roger’s emotions had been torn to ribbons.“I\\nt was a wake-up call,” Roger would later say of Peter’s death. “I guess he didn’t want me to be a wasted talent.”There was no doubting Federer’s commitment to the cause from then.In October, he went to Vienna and tore through the tournament. His first title in five months. After the final, he spoke from the heart.“I lost my coach Peter Carter a short while ago,” he shared. “This title is for him. I miss him a lot.”If you followed Federer’s breathless ascent to the top of the men’s game, there’s not a lot I can tell you about the years that followed that you don’t already know.He disassembled the “can’t beat big servers” criticism by taking out Andy Roddick and Mark Philippoussis successively to claim his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon the following summer.Starting in January 2004, he commenced a fabled run that barely makes sense to this day. He won eleven of the next sixteen Grand Slams, 247 of 262 singles matches from 2004–06, grabbed the World №1 ranking, and outright refused to let it go. He became the most famous, most popular, most successful, most recognisable tennis player in the world. People who’d never watched tennis before started watching because Federer was playing.In the summer of 2006, David Foster Wallace wrote of how colossally difficult it was to understand the scale of Federer’s talent through a television screen and yet how disarmingly simple he was to appreciate through the same medium. Stealing a line from a Wimbledon bus driver, he wrote Roger Federer as Religious Experience.Here’s a statistic that really blows my mind about the Religious Experience years. Following the Vienna title, won in the haze of Peter’s passing, Roger won his next twenty-three tournament finals in a row. He’d first demonstrated it in the Sampras match in 2001 but now it became a cornerstone of the experience of watching him: on the most meaningful occasions in tennis, Roger always delivered.There’s another small footnote to this astounding run.In 2004, two years to the day since Peter passed, Roger won the Toronto title, 7–5, 6–3 over Roddick in the final. With the gravity and symbolism of the day clearly foremost in his mind, he stepped up to speak.“I dedicate this to Peter — and Peter alone,” he said.This boy Roger, he turned out alright.T\\nhe peakity peak of the Religious Experience years inevitably invited comparisons with dominant streaks from the past.Federer’s 2004 was the first three-Slam year in men’s singles tennis since Mats Wilander’s 1988. It was the best individual year in men’s singles since Lendl’s 1986. (Federer would soon run up a 92–5 record in 2006, which is still a strong shout for the best individual year in the history of the sport.)Sixteen years since Wilander, eighteen years since Lendl. Sport has a very specific word association with these kinds of durations. For the first time, it came to be used with Federer’s name.This guy, everyone whispered, was a generational player.T\\nhe Religious Experience years are frequently disparaged these days.I’ve seen it said that the quality of competition wasn’t as good as it was at other times in the past. The leading lights in this era didn’t go on to win a lot of Grand Slams.That’s a poor way to assess the value of historical periods in any sport. For one, tennis is inherently rivalrous, so if one player dominates, as Federer did for so long, the others are automatically backgrounded to some degree. For another, it seems to lock in the disagreeable contemporary bias that any tennis not played with x or y player around means less for that reason.Mainly, though, it terribly short-changes Federer’s prime. Recollections of this era coming alive are an essential part of the Federer memory bank. What marks them out, for mine, wasn’t just how swiftly Federer turned the tide on abruptly overmatched opponents. Much of the thrill was also about how new and revolutionary it felt to watch him do it. Federer’s prime invited viewers to take a leap from the merely unseen and into the unimaginable.Even now, the exercise of drawing lines dividing Federer’s career into phases does a tremendous disservice to the Religious Experience years. We draw these lines now with neatness, with the benefit of knowing what came after.In 2006, however, Federer’s path was difficult to project into the future with any certainty. It feels preposterous to recall this now but Federer, with the vast majority of his legacy work already done, was still just twenty-five. Back then, it seemed as possible as not that he might win two or three Grand Slams a year for another ten years. It also felt just as plausible that, once he’d claimed the records he wanted, he might lose all motivation and quit.This is why any credible assessment of Federer’s legacy must endeavour to resurrect the invincibility he wore so naturally at his peak.For a long, long time, Federer was unstoppable. Not just in the sense that other tennis players lacked the capacity to stop him, but unstoppable in the present, continuous, forever tense.E\\nqually enrapturing was the flip side of Federer in his prime.When he did lose, especially when he lost big matches, it prompted questions laced with incredulity. This was a close to perfect tennis player, near as good as anyone has ever been. How did he lose? How could he? Did he get tired? Did he get hurt? Nervous? Frustrated? Did he make too many mistakes? Why did he do that? Why didn’t he just keep playing perfectly, employing his perfect everything, and keep winning?I remember asking these questions vigorously after Marat Safin beat him in the 2005 Australian Open semis. Federer stood on match point in the fourth set tiebreak. There was the drama of some kind of back injury. Safin had him dead to rights at 5–3 in the fifth set. Federer fought off multiple match points. He lost 9–7.I wasn’t angry or disappointed as much as I was confused. I wasn’t accustomed to him losing this big a match. I didn’t know where to look for answers. I needed to find a satisfactory explanation because the fragilities from his early career had never felt closer at hand. Would he start getting angry? Would he yell? Would he cry? Would he — perish the thought — start losing to big servers again?Looking back on it now, Federer losing that match made tennis exciting again. To those who didn’t like him, it opened the possibility that others might start winning again. And those who did like him simply couldn’t look away.I remember he played Ančić and Ivan Ljubicic in the semis and finals in Rotterdam soon after. Every chance he got, he stared holes through them. It was as if, in the back of his eyes, all he saw was Safin standing across from him in Australia.Take that, and that, and that, he went.Every ball hit with rage. Many, many points played in vengeance.He won Rotterdam, but it wasn’t pretty. Something about the younger, angrier Federer didn’t sit right in the body of the older, more mature one.But he kept winning. He beat Ljubicic again in the Dubai final, went to Indian Wells, won the thing without dropping a set, and then, from two sets down in the Miami final, came roaring back to win 2-6, 6-7⁴, 7-6⁵, 6-3, 6-1.His opponent in Miami that day was an extremely impressive eighteen-year-old kid.His name was Rafael Nadal.T\\nhat Miami final in 2005 kicked off a rivalry that came to define both players in equal measure.The extent of their chokehold over the men’s game across the next five years is made good by an astonishing statistic. Starting with Miami, eighteen of the next twenty-one Federer-Nadal matches were tournament finals. (The other three were semi-finals.) They took on each other in the Roland Garros final and then, straight after, at the Wimbledon final in 2006, 2007, and 2008.Seemingly overnight, tennis turned white-hot. Federer-Nadal suddenly became appointment viewing. Nadal’s role in growing Federer’s legend through these years cannot be understated. It works much the same way in converse too, in the sense that Nadal’s wins over Federer elevated his own stock like no other wins could.The apogee arrived when Nadal wrested the 2008 Wimbledon final from Federer in five wondrous sets, played out by the end in utter darkness. It’s on nearly everyone’s shortlist as one of the greatest tennis matches ever played. And even here — especially here — Federer needed Nadal and vice versa. I’ll argue that the value of Nadal’s achievement that night lay less in winning a Grand Slam on grass and more in finally taking Federer’s Wimbledon title from him.Nadal’s hot hand in a crackling rivalry was confirmed in another five-set classic at the Australian Open final in 2009. Memorably, Federer got emotional at the trophy presentation.“God, it’s killing me,” he wept.Wimbledon 2008, given the extreme conditions and how close the match was the whole way through, had been the quintessential classic with a coinflip to decide the winner. Australia 2009, however, had left no manner of doubt. Nadal had been better on the night, and had pulled away down the stretch.Unlike his post-Safin spell, Federer had six weeks off. When he returned, though, he still seemed to play on in anger more than in reconciliation. It would’ve been hard for him not to see Nadal every time he closed his eyes but, equally, none of his other opponents were anything like Nadal either.But then, at Indian Wells, he was taken out in three sets by a Scottish kid called Andy Murray. Soon after, in Miami, he ran into another young guy: a tough, hungry Novak Djokovic. It turned into a gnarly, biting contest, as Djokovic came from a set down to take a 3–6, 6–2, 2–0 lead. As the commentators chatted on about how Federer needed to exploit Djokovic’s potential jitters, Djokovic made two first-class recoveries. The second of them gave Federer an inviting ball halfway in the court. He skipped forward, at liberty to hit it either side of a defensively rooted Djokovic. Federer turned an angle with his feet, uncorked a forehand, and clattered the ball into the net.2–0, 30–0, and sinking fast, Federer had had enough. He smashed his racquet hard into the ground, re-arranging the thing.Nadal had been tearing at the cling film of calmness for the last twelve months, but this capitulation to Djokovic had now exposed the touchpaper.It was staggering to see. The crowd started booing and whistling at him.“I don’t think I’ve ever seen [that]…ever,” intoned the commentator, aghast.B\\nack on the European clay, Federer blew another lead against Djokovic in Rome.That made it six tournaments played, zero won, in 2009.By the standards of 99% of players to have ever played pro tennis, Federer was still having a great season. But, with four losses to Murray and Djokovic, the existential questions were mounting. For so long, Federer had been out on his own as the standard-bearer for men’s tennis. Now, for the first time, cut down to size by the Nadal losses, there loomed the once-unthinkable prospect of Federer being overtaken en masse by the mini-generation behind him.Federer responded like he had never responded before.Over the next eight weeks, he stepped up as the dominant player on Tour once again; a mesmerising 19–0 run that took in a first Roland Garros title and Wimbledon again, the latter clinched in a nerve-wracking 16–14 fifth set over Roddick. His sixth Wimbledon was also his fifteenth Grand Slam overall. It had taken him all of six years since his first Grand Slam to claim the men’s singles Grand Slam record. That feat alone will never be repeated.He ran into plenty of adversity along the way, too. Two sets and break points down to Tommy Haas in Paris. Two sets to one down to Juan Martin del Potro in the semifinals in Paris, before an adoring crowd pulled him through. No breaks of serve the entire four hours and sixteen minutes in the Wimbledon final, until it really, really mattered.Relatively speaking, Federer’s star slowly began to fade beyond this point. In fullness of context, however, the Religious Experience era was an elongated period of time — longer than most elite tennis careers — where Federer first set a singularly high bar, spearheaded the start of what we identify today as modern baseline tennis, engaged in one of the best stylistic rivalries to ever visit the sport, and then fought off elite challengers whose own approaches displayed telltale signs that he was the most widely studied tennis player on the planet.This phase had started out with Federer on an equivalent trajectory as hundreds of young pros from around the world. Over them, he had Peter Carter-reinforced advantages, of course, but the truly frightening thing about him was that, at most by the age of twenty-three, we were looking at almost certainly the most complete men’s singles player to have existed up to that point.Federer’s prime generated another important effect.It set in motion a distinct undercurrent of “if he wasn’t the way he was, would I be the way I am?” in the careers of Nadal and Djokovic in particular. They’ve since pushed each other hard for the Grand Slam record, as Federer has faded from view. It’s hard to argue against the idea, though, that the reason they’re running this hard in the first place is because they set out to chase Federer.There’s another, simpler way to anchor Federer’s prime.For eight straight years on the ATP Tour, the guy who was better than Roger Federer was the best men’s singles player in the world.It just so happened that, for six of those eight years, that guy was Federer himself.S\\nporting age is a curious phenomenon.We understand, as a matter of formal logic, that advancing years affect performance on the field of play. Elite sport is always a dance between mind and body. At the start, neither mind nor body are ready. Usually, the body is up for the challenge and the mind lags behind. Maturity, then, is often viewed as the process of the mind catching up with the body. The end goal is to peak — to perfectly align body and mind for a productive spell — before the two tracks begin to diverge again. In the latter part of sporting careers, the body starts to disobey, even though the mind is willing. The results can be brutal. That is the natural order of things.As he started slipping from his otherworldly levels at the start of the 2010s, Federer attacked the problem a different way. He started, in a sense, to increase the workload on his mind to compensate for a physical decline that he knew was coming. It commenced one of the most fascinating phases of his career.I lack the evidence to say this conclusively, but I sense that the meta prevailing in men’s tennis around then started to back itself into favouring time over reflexes. Technological changes made precision groundstrokes more accessible. Elite players started breaking off the constituent elements of tennis into micro-sports: serve game, return game, point construction, net approaches, transitions, scrambles. Tennis in general began to favour deeper contact points, putting more returns in play, more complicated shot chains, heavier spin, more power and athleticism.The skills that made Federer great at tennis — taking the ball early, killing points with creative shots, playing the game within the painted lines — were, at once, less valuable in this new era.Federer had a choice to make.He chose to double down on what brought him to the table. (The “playing within the lines” element of his game, in particular, is one he stubbornly refused to compromise on. It’s a commitment he kept to the very end, aided by a lack of runoff area on ground in Dubai, where he spent a lot of late career practice time.)The other, more bizarre consequence of this new era was that Federer was immediately hounded by calls to retire. As Nadal caught him up and surpassed him head-to-head and Djokovic came barreling down the pike as an elite player, it became apparent that both men held unique advantages over him. Even if he found a solution to one problem, it might not solve the other. In the summer of 2010, Federer briefly dropped out of the top two in the rankings for the first time since the end of 2003.At one level, these retirement calls were the inevitable cost exacted by the transcendence of his early career. People seemed to want to save Federer from himself; almost as if being anything less than the best would sully him immeasurably. At another level, though, the point was being made totally seriously. (Imagine, for a moment, that Federer had taken this seriously. What might his legacy have been then? I’ll tell you what. People would’ve said he ran away because he couldn’t hack it. In general, recalling this time has given me pause to consider how much the wearying clamour for his retirement has, itself, been retrofitted in our memories as a source of the elasticity of Federer’s late career.)When Djokovic’s first banner year, in 2011, took flight — from which point forward it was evident that there were two players capable of being consistently better than him — Federer was twenty-nine years old.It seems laughable to write that out with a straight face now. At the time, though, it wasn’t beyond possibility that Federer might flame out early. (Sampras, the most dominant men’s player of the previous generation, was twenty-nine when Federer took him out of Wimbledon in 2001.)As it turned out, we needn’t have worried.Federer’s terrific thirties heavily reoriented the possibilities known to elite players across sports. What we had previously known in the name of longevity in men’s singles tennis were streaks of random success: Ken Rosewall, Jimmy Connors, more latterly, Andre Agassi.Federer was different. His late career seemed forever in bloom; a constant stream of nearly-but-not-quite moments that confirmed he was elite even as Nadal and Djokovic largely gatekept him from major honours. Somehow, he was always there.Federer, as Brian Phillips so wonderfully put it in 2011, spent longer as a still-great athlete than any elite player in memory.The divergence of body and mind in the post-prime years is a delicate matter. The downturn can be rough. Careers and legacies can get bent out of shape alarmingly quickly. Yet, four years later after first diagnosing Federer’s still-great-ness, Phillips wrote of him in awe once again. Father Time, he noted, is cruel in condemning the most adored sportspersons to an exaggerated slow-motion sink to the bottom of the ocean. Except Federer did more than not sink to the bottom.He discovered a whole other universe in the depths of that ocean.I’m hard-pressed to exaggerate how incredible this Federer was to watch, across days, weeks, months, years. He was, of course, lucky with injuries and recovered well. Even allowing for all that, Federer operated with dramatic contempt for the properties of physics and time. He showed he could be still-great at an age when, prevailing wisdom dictated, he had no business playing top-tier tennis at all. Nadal and Djokovic have since, with different, perhaps better tools, confirmed that Federer’s late career trajectory is repeatable and sustainable.But Federer showed it was possible.It’s as big a part of his contribution to his sport as any title he ever won.A\\nbove all else, I marvel, in retrospect, at his drive.With anyone else in his position after the Roddick Wimbledon final in 2009, Grand Slam №15, you’d expect their motivation to shatter to pieces. It’s far easier to thought bubble Nadal or Djokovic’s mindset than Federer’s own at that time.Nadal especially might’ve been minded to think, Look, Federer has fifteen Grand Slams. I have six. I know I can beat this guy, and he’s got the record now, but he’s five years older, he’s probably going to get worse with time, if he sticks around at all. Maybe I can get to sixteen. Let me keep pushing to get there.To be fair, that’s probably not how that monologue went. It holds together, though. At a minimum, it was harder then to imagine why Federer would want to keep going than imagine that Nadal didn’t believe he could catch Federer’s numbers one day. Federer had every record in the book, save for Connors’ seemingly unattainable Tour match wins and Tour titles record (though, in the end, he got closer to both than he had any right to).As the Grand Slam race steadily took over men’s tennis across the 2010s, Federer’s unique stamp on it was to speak of taking the milestones as events. After all, many of the records Nadal and Djokovic were after, he’d chased them too. He’d got there first. He knew what it was like to be in their positions. He didn’t have to say how he felt about it, but he did, thoughtfully and graciously. He urged both Nadal and Djokovic to enjoy the milestones, as they would wins or titles. It’s a beautiful way to think about it, actually.It’s a weird thing to account for, but it’s still quite meaningful: The best advice on how to grapple with the significance of breaking Federer’s records came from Federer himself.G\\nreatest of All Time, as far as I care to trace it back, was a creature of the Muhammad Ali hype train in the 1960s. I don’t recall how or why it first crossed over into tennis but I’ve thrown my share of punches to curse the day it was. Through tedious overuse, Greatest of All Time (with its egregious acronym in tow) is, today, as hateful as it is inescapable; the microplastic debris polluting the ocean of tennis conversation.The all-consuming nature of the GOAT apparition in tennis is of recent vintage. Under the old rules of conversation, I suppose Federer’s phenomenal prime years gave him as good a claim to being the greatest as anyone who has ever played tennis.His extended twilight, however, put this GOAT thing front and centre. It was, to be sure, a singular time for what was going on around Federer. Nadal emerged unexpectedly, rivetingly as an exceptional two-surface threat. Simultaneously, Djokovic began distancing himself as the standout singles player of the 2010s. Both claimed Grand Slams by the handful, adding statistical heft to their own case to be the greatest. Both — Nadal steadily and Djokovic rapidly — caught up Federer. In the last two years, coinciding with the trough of Federer’s ambiguous semi-retirement, both have surpassed Federer’s Grand Slam total.These developments converge in one important way. They unapologetically shove claims to greatness in men’s tennis back in the direction of raw achievements.I suppose what’s most disappointing about this — even more than numbers taking over — is how promptly it has choked the space for conversation about what greatness really means.I’\\nll stick my neck out and say two things on this. Both have often been said before.One is that many of us don’t speak of sporting greatness solely (or even predominantly) in the language of accolades. The other is that Federer’s claim to sporting greatness was rarely about that in the first place.This thought came hurtling to me in early 2020. It happened around the time The New York Times published an opinion piece that was (I assume unironically) titled Roger Federer Will Always Be the Greatest (Even if He’s Not).The pearl-clutching of it all was insufferable. The meek submission to the tyranny of numbers, plucking the very worst bits of the GOAT noise to amplify, the characterization of Federer fans as delusional worshippers.I hated it.Even so, it got me wondering how I might begin to describe Federer’s impact on tennis. Like many who’ve attentively followed his career, I’d been sending my subconscious mind to visit this subject off and on for years. This was the first time, though, that I was prodded to turn my thoughts inside-out. Wound up as I was at the time by the New York Times piece, it came out as a rant.It ran like this:It’s been over two-and-a-half years since, but I reckon most of this still holds up. (“The best hands in the box for at least the last thirty years” was not, shall we say, my finest moment.)Part why, I think, is that, despite there now being clear daylight back to Federer in the Grand Slam race, that was only ever part of the men’s GOAT conversation. Records are important to a sport as taken with individuals as tennis is, for their base purpose of accounting. Of course they are. But they serve another purpose. They stand out for the moments created around them. This relationship is a true one. The more significant the record, the more meaningful the moment. Federer has been eclipsed in the Grand Slam race by two players who have already cut immense figures in tennis history. They’re self-evidently great at their sport, just as Federer was. Surely, though, that doesn’t erase the act of Federer claiming those records. He got to his Grand Slam record, didn’t he? He extended it, by two and then three and then four. Those were all huge moments at the time, for the same reason the ongoing race between Nadal and Djokovic fascinates us today.There’s a lot of wisdom in the old saying that records are meant to be broken. Meant to be broken, as if that is their purpose. There’s no saying that records are meant to be grimly held on to for the rest of your life so that your fans can win you GOAT points on the internet.E\\nven this statement of it, though, is vaguely unfulfilling.Nadal and Djokovic are very different players, but the blanket of domination they’ve cast over men’s tennis in their thirties does have one thing is common. They’re hurdling over opponents rather than solving them in unexpected ways. For the genius that undoubtedly resides in them both, their Grand Slam GOAT era, for want of a better term, has driven them to exhibit slower, showier, maximum output versions of themselves.On each of these counts, late-career Federer’s isolation from his two biggest rivals had always seemed rather outré. It took me until his final singles match, last year’s Wimbledon quarterfinal against Hubert Hurkacz, to fully absorb this.“[Federer’s] is a peculiar position,” I wrote that night.At the time, I had no idea if that was his final match. With that match on the line, Federer had chosen to weaponise the late-career freedom so typical of him to such a degree that his freedom had ended up using him as a weapon.It ended in a straight sets loss in a hundred and nine minutes.The knowledge that it was his final match casts that performance in an altogether different light. With the freshness of hindsight, it now feels as though Federer’s approach was a near-diabolical gamble.That realisation forced me to confront something else as well.Though he had fallen off a cliff athletically by the time Hurkacz happened, the truth is, Federer had been playing that way for years. He’d been getting away with it for so long that a beating like Hurkacz had been in the mail for a while. (No hard feelings, by the way. Hurkacz’s message on Federer’s retirement was adorable. “It was an honor to experience your game for all these years,” he wrote. What a great way of putting it.)As a general matter, it sucks to watch your sporting heroes get old. For Federer, his still-great-ness came with the devastating counterweight of watching him in matches like Hurkacz, which seemed to go on far longer than warranted. However, even this diminished Federer played as he always did: aggressive, risky, thrilling, occasionally magical. Ultimately, he flew so close to the sun propelled by the wings of his own ideological militancy that he got bageled in the last set he played at Wimbledon. There’s some dark hilarity in that.In the main, though, late career Federer made us keenly aware of how special he was.It might well be longer than a lifetime before someone that good at tennis that far past their best takes on peers that great by playing the way they did fifteen years ago, and so nearly wins the lot.It’s a big reason why, far beyond the tiresome GOAT question, Federer’s retirement brings with it the sobering sense that something unrepeatable has been lost forever.F\\nollowing an extended layoff, Roger Federer, “batteries full”, charged into 2017.Over thirty-five years old, playing with a double-digit number next to his name for practically the first time since he was an adult, 2017 brought with it the decided sense that he was playing with house money.Back in Australia, the odds aligned for him in manner that was truly divine. He won the damn Australian Open, with a heartstopping five-set final over Nadal.The year only got more absurd from there. Watching him cap a 32–2 run to claim his eighth Wimbledon and Grand Slam №19, I was speechless.To preserve my sense of disbelief, if nothing else, I wrote about Federer that July.It was the kind of run that wired shut any mouths that had questioned his desire to keep going. Thinking back to that time now, there’s certainly a good case to say that this might’ve been the most fun many fans have had watching Federer.Incredibly, he went one better the following January.Despite his cling film of calmness nearly coming undone in a tough spot in the quarters, Federer soared to another title at the Australian Open in a five-set final. Unlike in 2009, the tears that came on this January night were tears of happiness.Watching on from his box were two of his biggest fans: Bob and Diana Carter, Peter’s parents.“Peter set the foundation, and that’s why I’m so happy that his parents were at the finals and saw me win,” said the champion.“That really meant a lot to me.”This boy Roger, he really did do alright.Poignantly, it would be his final Grand Slam title.G\\nrand Slam №20 in Australia attached a hypnotic quality to Federer’s Grand Slam total.It also vaulted him, a few months out from turning thirty-seven, to the World №1 ranking. (“When it happened, it was just remarkable,” confessed one-time rival and long-time coach Ljubicic recently.) By any measure, this was a remarkable second wind.Cruelly, just when everything was sailing along smoothly, his game started to unravel.It began on a Sunday afternoon in March 2018.He had struggled all week in the desert at Indian Wells but, up until 5–4, 40–15 in the deciding set of the final against Del Potro, Federer had handled a difficult occasion consummately. It seemed like the cling film of calmness was about to bring him another title. One more measly point, and it would be fifty-three wins from his last fifty-six singles matches going back to the previous June.Instead, Federer froze.Del Potro came fighting back, levelled the match, and dragged it into a tiebreak, where Federer couldn’t get himself to land a single clean first serve. For the audacity of his comeback, Del Potro well deserved the win. But it was Federer’s demeanour after a tough week that had me worried.Prior to this, all his famous heartbreaks had typically come with the cold comfort that he cared enough for them to hurt. When he broke in Indian Wells, however, I saw a dumbfounded, slightly frightened player.“Serving 40–15,” he later said, “I don’t even know what the stat is, I probably win 90-something per cent [of the time].”“I would like to play that tiebreak again,” he offered blankly, “because I don’t know what the hell happened.”It was just one defeat, his first of 2018, but I could sense what was welling up inside me wasn’t an overreaction:The following week, in his first match in Miami, he surrendered another third set tiebreak. This time, it was to then-World №175 Thanasi Kokkinakis.To watch those two defeats back now is to see Federer’s abnormal skill level — for so long the thing that distinguished him from the pack — start falling out of his game in stages. Indian Wells-Miami 2018, for my money, is that line in the sand. The eliteness exhumes itself from Federer, hissing like the sound of escaping gas.The Kokkinakis loss, with tennis’ neurotic emphasis on ranking points, had another upshot. It used Federer’s own dream run at Indian Wells and Miami in 2017 as a stick to beat him with. The points he had claimed with those titles now turned cancerous. He forked over his status at the very top of the men’s game to Nadal, who himself hadn’t hit a ball in sixty-one days.“I deserve it after this match,” Federer lashed out. “That’s how I feel.”In the semis of his comeback tournament on the grass of Stuttgart in June, he took out Nick Kyrgios in another deciding set tiebreak. It was a good win.It wasn’t enough to right the wrong of the previous two, but, spurred by the “bit of extra motivation” of the ranking race with Nadal, it did help him briefly wrest back the ground he had surrendered in Miami.For the last time in his career, Roger Federer was World №1.A\\nkey sign marked out Federer in decline.His own outlook to defeats went directions other than him feeling wronged. The steely intensity that he packed in his kit bag after Safin in Australia or after Nadal in 2008–09 was persuaded by an unbending urge not to let those losses shape his own self-image. As bulletproof as his self-belief undoubtedly stood even deep into his decline, the early summer defeats in 2018 weren’t really followed by an energetic push to right those wrongs.When he found himself unable to close out match points against Djokovic in the 2019 Wimbledon final after two weeks of improbably brilliant tennis, there was shock and stunned silence, yes. But, after a month off that summer, he didn’t exactly turn up in Cincinnati wanting to smack tennis balls at people with bad intentions because he was seeing Djokovic everywhere he looked.The terrifying focus of the prime years had yielded to the sense that he was playing a game. Around the time of the Nadal losses, the idea of listening to his shrillest critics had felt abhorrent to him. Towards the end, however, even the retirement question didn’t seem to needle him quite so much.As Federer began to thin out his workload and slink from view, the direction taken by the men’s game made apparent just how big an outlier he had been and for how long. The playstyle shift that had started around Federer in the 2010s found full expression with him gone. The players taking Federer’s place signalled a resumption of the historical order. In the post-Djokovic era especially, tennis was re-taken by percentage players with strong metronomic instincts; tall, athletic guys who prefer to rack up attritive damage rather than land a spectacular knockout.Federer doesn’t respond to this description very well. He arguably never did.An understated facet of Federer’s game was that you could never arrive at him in final form by combining the sum of his parts. In a sport founded on reading a ball that takes half a second to reach you, Federer was, without too many exceptional physical advantages over his competition, able to guess, anticipate, and follow the ball, damn near every ball, onto its exact coordinates and uncork perfect swings. He did this hundreds of times a match. For sixty, seventy, eighty matches a year. For twenty-plus years. And then — and only then — did he hit the sort of kinesthetic burnout that finally made him look human. The full explanation for how he managed this is still a mystery.There’s something compelling about the idea that it might forever remain so; an enchanted forest living just beyond the edge of human discovery.F\\nederer is rather more than the sum of his parts in another way.To find out how, we must stipulate that his Carter-hewn calmness is the bedrock of his on-court behaviour. As this association came to be made by more and more viewers, a grave misrepresentation passed into the realm of established fact. Federer, it was popularly assumed, was an instructional in the mastery of self and process. Let us be fair and allow that if you met Federer on his ascent or at his peak, this came to be a defining feature of the Federer experience. Equally, though, let us admit that, if you watched him from the start, you knew his calmness was tightly fastened cling film and nothing more.Either way, his on-court demeanour came to serve an unexpected purpose. It soon became a canvas onto which fans could project their own emotions about his matches. Since Federer hardly ever disclosed what he was feeling, millions of people decided to play the game of feeling emotions in his place instead.In a sport with so much anxiety built even into the premise of merely watching along, this was a godsend. Some of us went catatonic. Others turned zen. The most long-suffering alternated between the two states. Federer’s gift to us all was that he rarely denied us the freedom to paint our own stories to fit his performances.It grew to be an essential part of the tennis loyalty bonding protocol. It never demanded a conversation of any notable length or detail to establish someone else’s connection with Federer. Federer fanhood followed the truest principle of shared sporting allegiances: You went through the same process I did with this guy, and came to the same conclusion I did.I’ve never seen anything like it before. I don’t know if I ever will again. That kinship, that sense of community, the glances shot in the direction of those watching with you after every point to say, you felt that too, right?To those who didn’t live through the you felt that too, right?-ness of prime Federer, no explanation will suffice. To those who did, none is necessary.W\\natching Federer retire at the Laver Cup this week brought home to me, for the millionth time, how borderline unbelievable it is that he’s actually really good friends with Nadal and Djokovic.In fact, all the players who you’d expect would dislike Federer seem to like him quite a lot. When he arrived on the men’s Tour, nothing dictated that you had to be friends with your rivals. It’s worthwhile, then, to wonder where tennis might be today if Federer, the pre-eminent men’s player straddling the past two generations, had decided to be a prick. Even outside that thought experiment, it’s quite extraordinary that the enormous downward pressure of the years of Nadal and Djokovic usurpation has provoked little antagonism from Federer, if any.There’s a deeper point here, too.Men’s sports are often held back by dense, crude, alpha male-style behaviour which needlessly ties together what it means to be the best and what it means to be a man. It would be dishonest to claim that tennis is bound to be a destructively aggressive sport, but it can certainly turn into that on occasion.Federer brought a very different energy to that position. His temper never really went away, of course. But, on the long view, he held together his cling film of calmness as securely as he could, and he’s never got nearly enough credit for taking his responsibilities as a role model very seriously. In time, I’m sure, people more qualified than myself will come to assess this with greater accuracy. For the moment, though, it’s worth pointing this out, as it was a keenly felt yet unspoken part of his appeal.For a period so many of us remember so well, Federer stood for everything the world’s best men’s tennis player was supposed to be. He did so while quietly detonating the trope of the alpha male that had, for so long, come with that territory.E\\nven more than how watching him made you feel, I reckon the ultimate tell-the-grandkids test with Federer is how much he is loved within tennis.The reactions from his fellow pros to his retirement announcement really brought this out.Sampras sent him a wonderful video message. “Every moment you shared has left us better off,” was Agassi’s sentiment. Roddick spoke about how Federer, even leaving aside everything he’s accomplished, stands out for how he conducted himself when no one was looking. Nadal, who fittingly stood on the same side for his final match, said he wished this day would never come. Djokovic said it was hard to see this day finally arrive. Del Potro declared his love with a plaintive, all-capitalized I LOVE YOU.Daniil Medvedev spoke of how playing him for the first time was one of the greatest feelings of his life. Stefanos Tsitsipas credited Federer as the reason he plays with a one-handed backhand. The newly minted World №1 Carlos Alcaraz, who has lived his entire life under the Federer sun but will now never get to play him, unwittingly started off a heartbreak emoji chain. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina joined it, as did John Isner and Karen Khachanov, before I lost track.It was the opening words of Serena Williams’ message, though, just a few days on from her own retirement, that really struck me.“I want to find the perfect way to say this,” she wrote. It spoke to something deep inside us all, I think. To the need to treat Federer’s tennis legacy, of all legacies, with particular care.Serena’s sincerity in searching for the perfect way to offer her tribute spoke louder than words ever could.F\\nederer goes without regrets.“I consider myself one of the most fortunate people on earth,” he said in his retirement address. “I was given a special talent to play tennis, and I did it at a level I never imagined, for much longer than I ever thought possible.”Even beyond that, he leaves tennis in peace. He’s not at odds with the direction the sport is going. He doesn’t hate it or feel betrayed by it or get bored by it. He goes with the golden handshake of being limited his own failure to keep going.In that, too, he has found resolution. He recognises that he has been on thin ice for a long time, and that, at forty-one years old, it can’t be that he’s chasing after something that’s hardly realistic anymore.He goes with a sense of completeness, leaving behind a fully constructed vision of how tennis could be played. A vision that was at once beautiful, skillful, daring, outrageous, efficient, silent, respectful, and glorious. To my mind, his tennis embodied what Wallace — he of the Religious Experience — once described as “that weird mix of caution and abandon we call courage.”Federer’s tennis greatness is supported in equal measure by the peaks he reached and by the longevity he enjoyed. It’s a legacy of tremendous, almost unfathomable weight, yet one that he has worn effortlessly, as only he can.Aside from the blessings Federer has already counted himself, we’ve been blessed with him in one striking way. His entire career has been documented. He played one thousand five hundred and twenty-six singles matches, all told. The vast majority of his career is on film somewhere. A big part of me balks at the thought of referring to his career in the past tense but, in reality, there will always be complete access to nearly everything he ever did on a tennis court.He’s a special figure to me in ways that are truly once-ever.I was both wowed by him and able to closely sense his vulnerabilities the first few times I watched him play. I was a teenager then, and I think needed to be one in order to get what he was about. Federer did much of his legacy work before social media and messaging apps invaded my life. I’m grateful that my recollections of the first half of Federer’s career are relatively pure, untainted by the opinions of people on the internet. Perhaps that’s part why his imprint has been so profound on us all, and why so much of his tennis legacy is so secure in my mind. Nearly everything I remember of prime Federer is cryogenically preserved from a time when big time tennis matches were discrete occasions, when one day didn’t melt indistinguishably into the next in quite the way it does now. He came along in the narrow slice of time — perhaps the last such slice of time I’ll ever experience in my life — when I could understand the quality and significance of what he was doing as well as trust myself to retain moments and the precise emotions that were bundled with them because our memories were our only method of clinging to the ghosts of tennis past.Federer also performed the rare feat of unshackling several matches he played from the quality of their context. Sportspersons who produce memorable bodies of work tend to compel investment for the confluence of greatness between art and artist. It takes an exceptional sportsperson, however, to compel investment in the mundane. Federer may have been the genius who pursued art for art’s sake but the Federer experience, in many ways, was about following the art for the sake of the artist.He serenely resisted the encroachments of Father Time in a way that I’ll always remember. With Federer, it was easier than with perhaps any other player to see the older, still-great player and imagine that you were watching the perfect tennis player he was in his prime.It was a mass dissonance of a type and to a scale that, I suspect, we’re unlikely to see again. That won’t be because post-prime tennis players will stop claiming titles. It’s more because the prime iteration of Federer was so perfect that the flashes of genius, even as they slowed to a trickle, appeared to emerge from that same quarry of endless perfection.Even as his ability to go back to that quarry demonstrably frayed, we hoped above hope that he could do so on command. Out of sheer goodwill, we allowed him — and demanded of ourselves — that loyalty for years. Towards the very end, it was a deeply questionable loyalty, as fierce as it was hopeless. Even so, I plan to hold on to it as long as I am able. Not because I can’t let go of that loyalty but because I find it utterly impossible to forget that feeling of rooting for Federer against all good sense.All of which circles back to the lesson I started with, and one that has been by my side through hundreds of his tennis matches down the years.It’s what Peter Carter first spotted in that nine-year-old kid in Basel in 1991, and it’s as powerfully true today as it was then.With Roger Federer, now and forever, it’s not what you look at that matters — it’s what you see.(With thanks to @tennisballfluff.)'], ['You Need A Break', 'Nora Zelevansky', 'Oct 25', 'https://noradz.medium.com/you-need-a-break-bcd4062e310b?source=home---------98------------------0----------', 'Why playing hooky can lead to more productivity and happinessYesterday, I took a break.I’m not talking about glancing purposefully away from my laptop screen for a few minutes periodically, which I am terrible about doing despite my eye doctor’s pleas.

Even on a crowded casino floor lined with blinking pachinko machines and video poker, Delightful Slots call to gamblers of every ilk.Win or lose, you’ll walk away happy after a few pulls of a Delightful Slot Machine.See, it all started when one of our Lead Game Designer read Aaron Walter’s Design for Emotion on the subway into work. Every morning, she learned more and more about the delight pyramid, a fascinating concept built on the notion that great user experiences are functionally sound, reliable, and usable. On top of that, the best products achieve an ultimate goal: they are pleasurable and delightful.Fair enough! we exclaimed in unison when the designer finished explaining it all. In fact, we all had just finished reading Don Norman’s Emotional Design: Why We Love (Or Hate) Everyday Things, where the value of delight was similarly emphasized.So we decided to go all in on Walter’s pyramid. We started focusing on creating our slot machines with a singular end goal: delight. That’s why our newest product comes with a monitor that tracks arousal levels through electrodermal activity. When these readings dip and the user clearly isn’t delighted, we amp up the delight and send them a delight blast to keep them hooked.We also created a virtual reality feature so that our users don’t have to deal with anything that will distract them from delight — like a clock, or text messages from significant others nagging them to stop playing slots with family savings.With delight as our new North Star, we’ll continue to drive differentiation and nurture the most loyal customer base in the midsize casino video gaming machines industry!Designing for delight has become a pseudo gold standard in product design, for better or worse.That said, simply designing for delight alone seems so pervasive and so … wrong.Before you bite my head off, hear me out. Admittedly, the concept of designing for delight used to make sense to me. On many occasions, I’ve been the designer introducing himself as being “passionate about designing delightful experiences.”No disrespect intended to the pioneers of this approach; I do believe that the idea of “delight” has served an important role. At the very least, it got us thinking beyond functional requirements to understand the deeper emotional story. But we’re in a different place now.We’ve seen the negative impact that “deeply delightful” technologies can have on mental health. There’s a fine line between delight and dependency.We’ve also examined the role of a designer as the conscience of a company and the catalyst for inclusive product change — not just a deliverer of delight. All things considered, I believe we are ready for a different end goal.At the risk of beating a dead horse, here’s the problem with designing for delight. As consumers, we invite products into our homes, relationships, and daily routines. The products we use shape the very ways we live. We ignore that simple truth when we design products with delight as our end goal.More specifically, we create a wall around our product interaction and ignore the broader life impact. Pulling the lever on the slot machine and watching the numbers spin, over and over, might bring some delight, sure. But what about the effect that these products have on our lives outside of the interaction?Never mind that these delightful experiences might also prey on our impulses, make us distrust ourselves, and even put us in an unstable financial position. As long as the slot machine is functional, reliable, usable, and delightful, we’ve done our job …It’s a myopic way of looking at the impact of the products we create. Because whether we recognize it or not, products transcend immediate interactions and affect our lives. Pull slot machines long enough and delight will turn to pervasive despair.At best, this approach minimizes the positive impact a product can have. It’s essentially saying the most a product can be is a rainbow cannon, spewing delight rays at us.At worst, this approach creates products that are harmful. Those delight rays can be toxic in high doses?… so be it. Well-being be damned.It’s time to rework Aaron Walter’s hierarchy of user needs a bit, with a new end goal at the top. In this new iteration, we’ll keep the bottom levels. A product does have to have a strong, reliable, and usable foundation to play a deeper role in people’s lives.At the top though, we’re dumping delightful/pleasurable, and we’re replacing it with humanized. As in, designed to create the best conditions for our lives.In order to humanize a product, we have to do two things:Here are two examples to show you what this revised hierarchy looks like in practice.Everybody’s favorite, right? But primary care visits are non-negotiables, and they’re experiences that we can design in very different ways based on what we prioritize.Deeper storyEngaging with one’s health can be unnerving and jeopardize our feeling of protection. It can trigger a feeling of vulnerability. And the reality is that many people ignore their health as a natural defense mechanism. In fact, as many as half of all cancer patients ignore warning signs.Walking into the doctor can pose a threat to our well-being and this can trigger our stress response. It can cause us to evaluate our fragile existence, and that’s something a La Croix can’t fix.Deeper valueFor example, Forward Health conducts a genetic test for each patient to understand their risk level for common diseases. This data initiates an open dialogue about the scary things, shining a light on them and bringing them out into the open. And it helps patients establish proactive strategies to cope with potential future vulnerabilities.This is not as effervescent as a La Croix, but it could have a much more positive impact on a patient’s life.Vacationing is the opposite of going to the doctor. But the approach still applies.Deeper storyFor many people, traveling touches the core of our well-being. It’s an act of self-expansion, a way to expand the boundaries of who we are and how we live. To escape the mundane and try new things.Deeper valueKnowing this allows companies to go way beyond a frictionless experience. For example, AirBNB’s redesign acknowledged this when it oriented its search experience around exploratory categories. Now when you search, you’re presented with unique lifestyle categories that allow you to discover and design a more expressive trip. Almost like you are trying out a new way of life.Granted, the idea of humanizing products is not completely novel. My guess is that you already approach design like this in some ways, whether you notice it or not.We’d be remiss if we didn’t credit Trent Harris and the Center for Humane Technology, who have done tremendous work to push this movement forward. They focus on exploring human vulnerabilities and our cognitive biases to create technology that isn’t unintentionally harmful to us. Jon Yablonksi, too, whose Humane by Design resource makes the idea of humanizing products more concrete by specifying specific UI tactics.We love this important work and how the authors approach this problem.But we sit on the other side of the problem. Instead of focusing on understanding human vulnerabilities and minimizing harm, we focus on understanding human motivations and maximizing well-being.Both are necessary. To meet these needs, we created a framework to understand holistic well-being. The framework helps us avoid the tendency to rely on intuition and experience alone, bringing in science-backed factors that help avoid bias and confusion.Our framework, the Periodic Table of Human Elements, came from our work at MIT’s Ideation Lab. We surveyed a wide variety of work in the fields of Humanistic Psychology, Positive Psychology, and Evolutionary Biology. It’s also based on our own study with about 500 people, which I’ve written about here.The Periodic Table is made up of 15 “human elements.” Each is a factor that has been shown to relate to well-being and our ability to live a good life (whatever that may mean to each of us). We like to remind people that, with ~8 billion unique humans on the planet, there is no singular notion of what a human needs. However, there are well-studied factors that are related to well-being.We use this framework in both steps of humanizing a product.To understand the deeper story, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to pinpoint which human elements are most triggered in a product interaction. In the primary care example above, we focused on PROTECTION (element #2). In the vaction example, we focused on SELF-DESIGN (element #11).On any given project, we end up identifying 2–3 significantly important elements that are relevant in that product interaction. We then analyze what specifically triggers these human elements and we develop opportunities for innovation.To add deeper value to people’s lives, it’s our job to figure out how to leverage this deeper understanding to provide a deeper value in people’s lives. This involves ideating new features based on each human element.We have created ideation prompts and examples to open up the ideation space, so to speak. This often leads to perfectly simplistic and intuitive ideas that hadn’t come up before. We find there is often a game-changing — often obvious — idea, ripe for the picking.From there, we can group features into categories to create actionable value props that add deeper value to people’s lives — the critical last step.Well-being is such a powerful design cue because it prompts so much of our day-to-day decision-making. Even so, it’s surprisingly easy to ignore this deeper realm.As you return to your own design journeys, here are a few things to remember about humanized design and the Periodic Table of Human Elements:Hello!I’m Alex Klein.

It seemed fancy at the time: nice offices, luxury cars in the parking lot, lots of women in heels buzzing around. My job certainly didn’t pay enough for one of those BMWs, but I did get business cards and dental insurance. I was 22 and had just moved to Arizona with no money and even fewer connections. I felt lucky to be there.The work wasn’t glamorous. As a junior copywriter, I spent half my time proofreading others’ work, and the other half trying to drum up creative ways to write about 4,000-square-foot McMansions in planned communities on the fringes of the Phoenix suburbs.Three months in, I had run out of ways to talk about open floor plans and stainless steel appliances. I’d also noticed a few things — like how one senior writer’s copy was always littered with creepy innuendo. Or how the agency owner would scream at junior account staff whenever a client was upset. Or the fact that we had to be there at 8:30am, no matter how late we’d worked on a pitch the night before.Then Andrea showed up. Like me, she had just moved to Phoenix with her partner. Unlike me, she’d spent years working at large agencies in Chicago. She took one look around and realized the place was a mess.Within weeks, I started spending half my days working from her office. We’d bounce ideas off each other and give critiques. We’d get burritos and crack jokes about the creepy guy. She made my work better, and she taught me a lot.For one, she taught me that I wasn’t lucky to be there. I was actually underpaid and underleveled. I quit that job after 10 months.But Andrea? She just visited last month. We texted last week. She’s one of the first people I’d call in a crisis. I wouldn’t trade that friendship for anything.In August, Gallup released a report based on surveys from 15,000 U.S. adults claiming that not only has having a “best friend” at work long been correlated with higher levels of workplace satisfaction, but that this difference has become even more pronounced since the start of the pandemic:Meanwhile, back in March, Capterra released the results of a very different study. They asked 1,000 U.S. employees to rank the relative importance of 14 job satisfaction factors (such as “job security” and “compensation”). Researchers then looked at which factors were most frequently listed within respondents’ top three. What they found was that “relationships with coworkers” was the least important of all 14 factors they tested — less important than recognition, learning opportunities, or relationships with managers. Just 11% of respondents listed it in their top three.In that study, just over half of remote respondents also said that having friends or other social relationships at work was either minimally or not at all important to them. “Friends at work? Today’s employees aren’t interested,” the study concluded.So one study tells us that people don’t care about work relationships anymore, and another tells us that people with work friends are happier than those without them. Huh.This juxtaposition got me thinking: Are we trying to convince ourselves that work relationships don’t matter to us — and ending up more isolated and miserable as a result?The more articles about work friendships I read, and the more talk with my clients and network about their experiences, the more I believe the answer is yes.Five years ago, Dr. Marisa G. Franco started her first job at a university. As the only Black assistant professor on faculty, she decided that befriending her colleagues was too risky. “I felt the weight of being very different, and worried the more I exposed myself to them, the more I might experience racism and microaggressions,” she told the New York Times.But that self-protection ended up coming at a steep cost:So when Dr. Franco got a new job in 2019, she took a different approach: she started telling her colleagues more about herself — everything from her summer vacation plans to her experience being mistaken for a different Black person at work. It changed her life so much she’s now publishing a book on platonic friendship.Dr. Franco was certainly right about one thing at that first university job: opening up to colleagues carries risk. People could treat you differently, they could gossip, they could betray you. Management could use your connection to your colleagues as a means of manipulation — making it seem like you’re letting your friends down if you set boundaries.That’s the thing about vulnerability: it’s risky, by definition. But what we don’t talk about often enough is the other side of the equation.For Dr. Franco, that risk was profound loneliness — something researchers were already deeply concerned about before the pandemic, and are now seeing as a crisis of its own.In my coaching work with people in tech and design, I hear about this kind of loneliness all the time — particularly from people who changed jobs during the pandemic, or whose teams had high turnover. And it’s not just me: UX designer-turned-connection coach\\nKat Vellos\\nspent this spring talking with designers about their experiences with connection and disconnection, and she found that time and again, loneliness was a major issue. Making matters worse, she wrote, “design culture has an addiction to perfectionism,” so people don’t talk about what’s wrong. In this environment, “lonely designers can falsely believe that they’re the only ones who are having a hard time.”“But I’m not lonely,” you might protest. “I just keep my social life outside work!” That’s great, and I do think trying to get all of your social needs met at work is a recipe for problematic power dynamics and eroded boundaries. By all means, center your social life elsewhere.But friendship at work isn’t just about happy hours and “forced fun.” It’s about feeling seen and understood. It’s about feeling like people are in your corner when things get hard.It’s about knowing that even on your worst day at work, you’re not alone.That kind of connection only comes when you lower your guard, though — when you take yourself off defense, and find ways to be yourself with the people you work with.In March of this year, I asked people in tech and design how their relationship to work had changed over the course of the pandemic. More than 200 people responded, and over and over — across job functions, age ranges, locations — I heard the same themes:I cheered when I read these responses. It felt like a reckoning — a rejection of “lean in” and “rise and grind,” and a reclamation of humanity over hustle.But I’m also worried at the level of cynicism and despair I see in people right now.I’m afraid we’re not just distancing ourselves from corporate bullshit, but actually isolating ourselves from the very things we need to make it out of this moment: Community. Connection. Care.As Yvonne Lam put it recently:If you’re not familiar with the term, enmeshment is a psychological concept usually used to describe family systems where boundaries between people are unclear or nonexistent — such as a parent who is so involved in their child’s life, the child struggles to form an independent identity, or is even punished for doing so. Applied to work, enmeshment might mean adopting a company’s goals as your own, prioritizing work above all else, and identifying so strongly with your career that you’re not even sure who you are without it.In other words, it’s what a lot of professional work culture touted as totally normal before the pandemic.In times when our intrinsic motivation is low — that is, when our work doesn’t feel personally meaningful — it’s actually our work relationships that can save us from burnout. In one study from 2010, which tracked several hundred university employees over a two-year period, researchers found that “for employees who do not experience pleasure or do not find personal meaning in their work, high-quality relationships with coworkers may help them cope with their work experiences and reduce the likelihood of burnout.” They also found that the converse is true: “poor interpersonal relationships with coworkers can make people more vulnerable to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization over time, as well as to depletion of feelings of personal accomplishment.”Depersonalization. It’s a core facet of burnout, and one I wish we talked about more often. Because depersonalization isn’t just about our own feelings. It’s “the development of dehumanized and cynical attitudes” toward the people around us.That’s what I’m worried is happening right now — that through the cloud of burnout, too many people are seeing their colleagues less like fellow humans, and more like time-wasting barriers standing between them and their “real lives.”That’s not setting boundaries. That’s just being a jerk.Andrea’s not the only lifelong friend I met at work. I met Christine at another agency in 2010. I’ll be at her wedding in October. I met Amanda in 2005 during a brief stint at a for-profit university. We talked last week. I met Katie during training for a call center job in 2003. I saw her when I visited my hometown last month.I’ve also lost work friends. Some faded out once we stopped working together. A couple fell apart when one or both of us didn’t react to work stress well. I’d love to go back in time and handle those situations differently — set stronger boundaries, communicate my needs more effectively, be a better listener.But I don’t regret any of those relationships, not even the failed ones. They made me who I am.I definitely talked about work with all of these friends — sometimes too much, if I’m being honest. But we didn’t just bond over toxic bosses or rude customers. We bonded over live music, home cooking, progressive politics. We bonded through sharing our heartbreaks, our family dramas, our life changes.We bonded because we took the risk of opening up to one another, and found we had a lot more in common than our job titles.That’s a risk I’ll keep taking.Our newsletter includes essays like this, leadership tools, and information about our workshops and programs.

You can catch up here; I won’t reiterate it. I believe Kanye is ill, and I’ll return to ignoring him soon after this post. This post is about Adidas, Gap, CAA, and his other corporate partners. It is about the moral obligation we have to draw a line.Authoritarian power, fascism especially, often rests on the persecution of a group. Fascists ascribe the problems of society to the influence of a minority and argue that controlling or eliminating that group will solve a social ill. The most popular target for this form of social weaponization, for hundreds of years, has been the Jews.Making up 2% of the U.S. population, and only 0.2% of the world’s population, Jews are, year after year, the target of more anti-religious hate crimes than any group. In the two-year period 2001–02 bookending 9/11 — when Islamic terrorists killed 3,000 people — the FBI identified 636 anti-Islam hate crimes in the U.S., up from just 61 in the two prior years. Over the same period the FBI identified 1,974 anti-Jewish hate crimes — three times as many as directed at Muslims, more than half the religious hate crimes committed during the period.The anti-Islam number was the anomaly. Year after year, more hate crimes are committed against Jewish Americans than against any other group except Black Americans. (There are six times as many Black Americans, and in total they suffer twice as many hate crimes.) The situation is similar abroad and over time. Persecution of the Jews is so common, there’s a Yiddish word for being massacred: pogrom. QAnon is strange and vile, but likely ends up only a stain on this American era. Antisemitism is history’s most enduring and deadly conspiracy theory.That’s why special attention should be paid to tropes like “the Jewish media.” The real demon, of course, is demonization, of any target. The history of discrimination and violence against “out” groups is extensive, from the Armenian genocide, to the mass killings of Christians by ISIS, to China’s detainment of Uyghurs, and much, much more. In fact, the Nazis did not limit their attacks to Jews alone. They targeted Romani people, Black people, homosexuals, and the handicapped. Whoever the target, identifying a group, blaming them for society’s problems, and encouraging persecution, including violence, against them is the fascist playbook. We cannot ignore these tactics in the rantings of billionaire celebrities, regardless of what we think of their music, their shoe designs, or their mental health.A companion tactic is the assertion of victimhood by the fascists themselves. “Replacement theory” is the noxious combination of both, asserting that the persecuted minority will somehow supplant the majority. The rhetoric of fascism is like a battery, drawing energy from contradiction. A self-proclaimed billionaire, for example, wailing about how oppressed he is.We have incorrectly conflated the liberal tradition of “free speech” with neutrality, with protecting the dark shoots of fascism in the name of tolerance. By the time speech has flowered into actions that cannot be ascribed to a “lone wolf” or the “mentally ill,” it has ripened into a movement. Movements are harder to stop, and the cost of resistance becomes so high that good people stop doing and saying the right thing as the understandable instinct for self-preservation kicks in. Later, we find eloquence and grace only in our regret.I have the feeling that we let our consciences realize too late the need of standing up against something that we knew was wrong. We have therefore had to avenge it, but we did nothing to prevent it. I hope that in the future, we are going to remember that there can be no compromise at any point with the things that we know are wrong.— Eleanor RooseveltStanding up against the rhetoric of hatred has nothing to do with censorship. There is no law forbidding people from employing the rhetoric of oppression, nor should there be. But no principle obligates us to accept them in media or business relationships.A pillar of state-sponsored horror is the steady normalization of stereotyping and blaming. One person ranting about the Jews or anyone else is readily identified as an outlier and ignored. But as these claims multiply, as they have recently, they seem less outrageous. Political scientist Joseph Overton postulated that at any time there is a range of policies the population deems acceptable, but this “window of discourse” is not constant. It’s become a strategic objective of extremist groups to shift the “Overton window” over time toward their position by using rhetoric and advancing policies just outside the current scope of societal acceptance. And as the volume of hateful rhetoric rises, as research has shown, so too does hate crime.The rise of fascism — the normalization of hatred — is concomitant with the accommodations of powerful people who register political and financial gain by looking the other way. “Appeasement” is historically associated with Neville Chamberlain, the U.K. Prime Minister who caved to Hitler’s territorial demands rather than risk war with Germany — only to make the eventual war more costly. Chamberlain is unfairly singled out. Much of the British ruling class supported his position, and the U.S. Congress passed law after law barring aid to those threatened by the Nazis until Pearl Harbor made such a position untenable. Accommodation inside Germany began years earlier, with Hitler’s rise to power (via an election) in 1932.Although Chamberlain is the poster child for appeasement, often the key enablers of fascism are not politicians, but corporations. Large companies benefit from stability, the expansion of their nation’s sphere of influence, and the centralization of power at the expense of the individual — many of the central themes of fascism. It’s no surprise that corporate power is often the handmaiden to authoritarian rule. I write that not as an indictment of corporations — corporations are essential. They are how we organize human effort to accomplish extraordinary things, from electric cars to vaccines. But as corporations become more powerful, their rejection or enablement of hate speech takes on additional importance.Corporate accommodation of and support for the Nazis is well documented, from Adidas to Volkswagen to Krupp to IG Farben. Multinationals flooded into Pinochet’s Chile as he murdered his political opponents by the thousands. Vladmir Putin’s Russia has made “oligarch” (once simply a term for a member of a ruling clique) into a synonym for business leader. The risk is even greater today, considering the role corporations play in modulating our national discourse. The pure pursuit of profit can lead to dark places. There has to be a line, a moral consideration in place.Drawing that line can be hard, because the leaders of large companies are culturally inclined toward, if not political neutrality, avoiding political adventurism. Corporations take political positions for business reasons, and 99% of the time, the best position is none. Donate to both sides, lobby for regulatory capture, and then stand on the sidelines.But neutrality in the face of evil is not neutrality. Amorality is too easily hijacked by the immoral. Hannah Arrendt was fascinated by Adolf Eichmann, the architect of Hitler’s death camp system. He evidently had no ideology of his own, just a “manifest shallowness,” she wrote, “which made it impossible to trace the incontestable evil of his deeds to any deeper level of roots or motives.” If Meta were to change its name again … “Manifest Shallowness” strikes me as a decent fit.If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.— Desmond TutuWhich brings us back to Kanye. And to the corporations that did business with him. Their decision to sever ties is important. Not because they need to “cancel” Kanye. It’s not about Kanye, but drawing a line, arresting the normalization of the demonization of a minority.In the case of Adidas, the ink for this line will cost shareholders hundreds of millions, if not billions, in shareholder value. The shoe maker has been criticized for waiting 10 days to cut ties. Ten days is an eyeblink in history (and even if management made the decision in 10 minutes, the logistics and legalities of responsibly disentangling a multibillion dollar relationship take time). The company should be commended for its actions.As expensive as it was, Kanye did Adidas, the corporate world, and maybe America, a favor. As John Oliver put it, “The answer to where you draw the line is literally always ‘somewhere.’” If you never draw one, you forget how. So when someone goes to “death con 3,” society’s writing hand rediscovers penmanship. It helps to practice our cursive so we know we can do it. Drawing a line is a chance to remind yourself, your employees, your shareholders, and your customers that you’d rather take a stand now, when the cost is only profits vs. something much worse.In writing and presentations, I often point out that much of my success is due to my circumstances — being born in America, getting a state-sponsored education, etc. But the real roots of my good fortune run even deeper. During the Blitz, my mom was a 4-year-old Jew, sleeping in the London tube. Had the British not drawn a line, and then the Americans and Russians, it’s likely that a 21-mile-wide strip of water would have been breached, and my mother’s life would have ended with a train ride. And someone else would be writing this newsletter.It should be noted: The allies drew a line against fascism and potential invasion, not antisemitism. The costs would have been less dear had we drawn those lines earlier. The line on Kanye should have been drawn sooner. Every elected leader, citizen, and CEO must ask themselves, Where is my line?

I imagined talented people getting to make great work for an organization that believed deeply in the power of illustration. I mean, what could be chiller than drawing all day? To a casual observer, it’s easy to take for granted the pioneering role Dropbox has played in brand illustration. But over the last ten years, there have been a handful of times when illustration as a Dropbox hallmark has been in jeopardy. It took nearly eight years of speaking up in meeting rooms and drafting late night email essays to fight for illustration’s power. This is because illustration has long existed at ground zero of Dropbox’s identity crisis: are we consumer or enterprise? Do we speak to those audiences in different ways? It’s a historic tension that still hovers over our illustrators today.In December 2016, I received the honor of leading the Dropbox illustration team. My first goal has been to understand the decisions that were made to cement Dropbox’s artistic legacy. As the illustration team looks forward to evolving and pushing the brand forward, I think it’s important that we understand the legacy and carry it with us while we advance. In preparation for this historical recollection, I had the pleasure of interviewing some of the influential creative minds that helped define and prove illustration’s heavyweight status. Through these interviews, I found a powerful story about taking giant leaps of faith against opposing ideas and data to prove the power of illustration.Illustration at Dropbox comes from very humble beginnings. Jon Ying, who does not consider himself an illustrator, drew a piece for a blog post about some bugs they were working on. The image portrayed a stick figure chasing after a bug with the intent to smash it to oblivion, and it sparked an intensely debated existential question for the company. Who are we? Should we be just like all the other respectable companies and play it safe? Or should we try something interesting and make a statement? The decision to publish the stick figure wasn’t easy, but it was an important decision. Users can be fickle. If they didn’t trust that Dropbox was going to take care of their needs, they were out. The drawing could actually cost the company. However, Jon believed simple universal drawings connected on a human level and inspired empathy when things might not be working right. He believed it could even help retain customers through some tough times.In the early days of a company, these decisions can become hard to untangle, as it’s often two heartfelt, passionate beliefs pitted against each other. This decision was hashed out in an absurdly unconventional way. It took a long, drawn-out Dance Dance Revolution battle between the two founders. It lasted 23 hours straight. No sleeping. No eating. No bathroom breaks. No mercy. Ok, not really — it was actually just a meeting, but in that meeting, co-founder Arash Ferdowsi passionately fought for Jon Ying’s vision. He believed Jon was on to something. After all, in the early days, Jon worked in customer support. He was the most connected to the users, and Jon was damn good at connecting with an audience at a universally human level.Arash and Jon’s passionate vision was met with extreme doubt. There were just no data or examples to support that the style would be a good decision. At face value, what Jon Ying was asking was pretty nuts. If you can think back to nearly a decade ago, no one was using illustration in brands like Dropbox, especially not stick figure comics. Drew Houston (CEO and co-founder) had good reason to think it was a silly idea. But that’s the thing: it was a silly idea. It didn’t take itself too seriously. It wasn’t beholden to corporate trends or best practice marketing and sales knowledge. It thumbed its nose at being put in a box.What the style did have, however, was a well-reasoned argument for why it would work. Jon’s solution worked well for the biggest realities Dropbox was facing at the time. The product was young, it went down almost daily in 2008, and the team needed a quick and easy way to communicate with customers in a way that felt like there were humans working on the problems. At the time, Dropbox couldn’t afford an illustrator, and there was a need for a lot of communication at the time. Jon explains, “There actually wasn’t much inspiration or thought that went into the early day illos. They were in many ways driven by necessity, chance, then reflection.” In those days, debate about using stick figure drawings often resolved itself through the classic engineer’s agreement: try it, and if the data didn’t support it, they wouldn’t do it again. Fortunately for us, people really responded to Jon’s work. They even went so far as to take time out of their days to email about the drawings. It was a hit!As the need for illustration grew, one of the next challenges was to draw something for the 404 page. This would be the first introduction of illustration inside the actual product. The only problem was that Jon didn’t have any drawing supplies other than plain ol’ pens. Arash decided the two of them would go to the Walgreens downstairs and buy some art supplies. They picked out some colored pencils and drawing paper, and voilà, the Dropbox aesthetic was born. Jon drew a version of the Dropbox logo à la Escher, and it was a big hit internally. However, despite internal praise, there was another roadblock for Jon to overcome. Creating silly drawings on the blog or in emails is one thing. But putting them in the product? That’s crazy talk! Convention was loud and clear that this color pencil drawing of insanity was an unprofessional approach. 404 pages are a moment of frustration, and Jon was making a joke? The challenge had to be raised again: “Do we want to be a company that does this kind of crazy stuff?”At this point, you probably see a pattern here. A desire to be innovative or different will always meet its counter argument to do what is expect and tested. This debate will go on in every company throughout time. However, Jon wasn’t disheartened by the debate, and he didn’t take his initial wins for granted. He understood illustration would be continually on the chopping block, so Jon took every chance he could to build meaning and value around the work that he did. “We weren’t simply being irreverent for irreverence’s sake,” Jon remembers. “There were other factors of familiarity and approachability that we wanted to capture. A kind of a ‘you can do it, too’ spirit we wanted the user to feel.”As the style progressed, one of the main components of meaning for the work was to connect with people in a more personal way. Jon started to build a means of conversation within his work by using Easter eggs in the product. These little moments of discovery made people say, “Oh, that’s clever.” And more importantly, it invited them to think, “I’m clever for getting their reference. I relate to the people who work at Dropbox.” Jon had started building relationships and friendships with people through his art. There were even times when strangers literally walked up to Dropbox employees on the street and gave them a hug. That type of relationship was traditionally considered impossible to create with a company.Jon’s philosophy didn’t just stop at an emotional connection. He also built out a philosophy for the thinking behind the work. Jon wanted Dropbox’s users to understand the imaginative journey one must take to build this type of product, and how hard Dropbox employees worked to make it a reality. Dropbox needed users’ trust, and that meant sharing a piece of Dropbox’s culture with them. To do that, Jon devised a fantasy world where metaphor and pop culture collided to put a fun spin on what was ultimately an extremely boring concept — cloud storage. When the need arose to communicate about version history, Jon could use a DeLorean from Back to the Future. When talking about mobile capabilities, Jon would show characters enjoying life with all their files in a kite. He crafted compelling reasons around the use of illustration, so illustration would be in a solid position the next time it was second-guessed.Jon contributed many conceptually interesting illustrations, but he is the type of guy who loves to take a new thing head on. Soon enough, he became involved in too many parts of the company to keep up with the illustration work needed. It was time to hire some new talent. In a serendipitous series of events, Dropbox had recently contracted Ryan Putnam to build out a design/illustration system for their big DBX event. His work was amazing, and Dropbox decided to bring Putnam on board to help with the giant mountain of work. This is the beginning of what has fondly been referred to as the “Putnam era.”Dropbox was growing very quickly. The product was a budding success, and the need for talent was massive. If you’ve never been part of a small company that’s rapidly growing, let me take a minute to describe it to you. It’s insanity. Every task, job, problem, success — it’s all brand-new to everyone involved. The entire company is making educated guesses while taking on responsibilities they never thought they’d be able to effectively help out on. This type of growth is a key component to the revolutionary success of the tech industry. People aren’t afraid to make mistakes. They’re encouraged to move fast and learn quickly what does and doesn’t work. The tough part managerially is that everyone’s opinion on everything is valid. For illustrations, this makes for a lot of, “We’ll know it when we see it.” That means every illustration becomes a monumental effort of meandering through the darkness. Illustration transforms from a delightful part of the brand to a battle zone of opinions. This is the chaos that quickly started to manifest around the time Ryan Putnam joined the team.Putnam was a generalist, which was perfect for Dropbox at the time. He designed and illustrated for products, marketing needs, blogs, internal comms, etc. The sheer volume and variety of the design work needed was pretty staggering. Putnam needed to move quickly, so he leaned on an illustration style he was most comfortable with. Putnam’s style was warm and approachable. It was a logical evolution for the Dropbox brand, but at the same time, designers Alice Lee and Allison House were also creating illustrations in their own styles. There was a moment in time where work was made in any style an artist wanted. There was minimal oversight because there was so much to be done. If it felt good enough, it made it through. There was a lot of talented people creating great work. But as it turns out, that’s not a sustainable model for a brand. If anything goes with the illustration, then anything also goes with the feedback, and chaos started to take root.Where Dropbox’s illustration once had a focused point of view, it was starting to jump all over the place. It started to seem like an afterthought as opposed to something deeply integrated into the company’s DNA. Putnam understood that if an illustration system lacks a strong point of view, then everyone and their dog will impose their uninformed opinions. This was causing chaos where a single piece of feedback could set projects back or even derail them completely.Putnam saw the writing on the wall. Illustration needed to be systemized, or it was going to be replaced. He dedicated his tenure at Dropbox to building a guide for how illustration was created and measured. This included a specific point of view on how the company gave feedback about illustration. It turns out that a lot of meetings go into educating people about brand best practices. Like, a gross amount. And on top of those meetings, Putnam and the team still had to get their actual design work done. At this point, Putnam started walking the same path that Jon Ying had to pave in the beginning. To ensure illustration’s place in the brand, they had to work twice as hard.Putnam started exploring an aesthetic system that could be scalable as they hired new designers. He understood that in order to scale their team, a foundation needed to be created for illustrators to work on top of. Dropbox brought in illustrator/designers Zach Graham, Justin Pervorse, and Linda Eliasen to help scale the design language. Ultimately, Zach and Putnam dedicated their focus to creating an updated brand style that honored Jon Ying’s style while also evolving it into a more refined digital style. They created an easy-to-replicate system of using objects to tell stories. Often the objects had smiles. Zach jokes, “At one point, I think everything had a smile.” People tend to give a nostalgic self-aware laugh at the smile period. There was a real mandate for the illustrations to convey delight. There was a lot of delight. 😀The emerging system was working. They started scaling it out to other products and pressure testing it as a broader language. Putnam was able to build a precedent for the work that served as common ground for feedback and furthered illustration’s role in the company. This was a major win for the company’s ability to understand and communicate ideas through illustration. There was one big issue, though. Through the process of systemization, the style had lost a key component. It lost its whimsical, conceptual nature. Where Jon Ying once strove to never show a folder or file, the style now was primarily object-based.The contrast between a more objective style and purely conceptual pieces is very interesting. In Jon’s days, the product was very conceptual. The user’s stuff was now in the cloud. People didn’t even know what “the cloud” was. It was brand-new, and the company needed to sell why this was something worth moving toward. It was closer to a lifestyle connection. Whereas during the Putnam era, people understood the cloud, but they needed to understand the practical uses of Dropbox. This meant that mentally connecting one’s environment to Dropbox was helpful in showing its usability. But ultimately, one or the other wasn’t good enough for the team. They constantly thought about what was working and how to take it to the next level.While Dropbox was growing rapidly, new hires were brought in from a variety of other successful companies. Leadership got deeper and wider, and illustration had a new crop of people to prove itself to. The new illustration system was working, but so much changes quickly in startups. They have to zig and zag constantly. This meant new hires across the company could only use what they had learned from other companies to inform what should happen at Dropbox. After all, they were hired for their past successes. The only problem was that Dropbox wasn’t like any other company. The people that joined Dropbox wanted to work there because it has a certain je ne sais quoi, but they had a hard time translating that internal culture to how the brand should sit in the world. The company had gone full circle, and illustration was up for another round of “survive the chopping block.” Some believed deeply that it was time for Dropbox to feel more in line with what other companies were doing. The problem was that most companies relied heavily on pictures of boring people just looking at their phones in a work scenario. Lame!Illustration had to step up its game. It had to serve as an emotional connection that far outweighed what other companies were doing with photography. One chance to prove that emotional power arose with the need to create a “please don’t downgrade” page. The illustration appeared when users wanted to downgrade from a paid plan to the free plan. Dropbox needed something to help users understand they get a whole lot of bang for their buck. Zach explains, “I wanted to figure out how to make people feel guilty without being an asshole. At that time there were smiley faces on everything, and I didn’t want to do that. I didn’t want to draw a file crying. It wasn’t going to work.” Zach came up with the idea of two differently sized fishbowls. He portrayed the concept of space without connecting it to files at all. He wanted you to remember how sad your pet would be if they were in a cramped space. You don’t want to be the type of person that lives in a cramped space, right? Apparently, people can really relate to the emotions of a fish, because it convinced people not to click that final “Yes, I’m sure” button. Some say this illustration saved the company millions of dollars. Others say, “Whoa, cool, people say it was that much?” Either way, I wasn’t able to track down the actual statistic for its success, but its impact on the future of illustration was quite significant.While the fishbowl pieces served as the sacrificial lamb on the chopping block, the big debate about if we should move away from illustration roared on. Illustration had proven itself useful in certain battles, but there was still the question of whether it was the right tool to win the war. “The sentiment was that the company needed to grow up,” Zach recalls. “I agreed with that sentiment. We did need to grow up. But illustration can be conceptually sophisticated, and that’s what I was interested in.”At the time, it was difficult to find the right answer between both sides. Although there was a tighter system for understanding illustration, there was no clear way for other parts of the org to understand what brand was or how it should be approached. There wasn’t a brand team at the time. There was just a pool of designers working on pretty much everything. While Zach’s conceptual illustrations were still proving their worth on the growth and monetization side, it started to become clear that there needed to be a defined process for making brand decisions. The contrasting ideas about illustration’s worth were not going to solve themselves.Every pillar of the company had specific needs, and there wasn’t a clear path for anyone to work alongside brand experts to create meaningful work for those needs. They didn’t understand that a brand’s major power was that it could make hard-to-understand concepts relatable at a gut level. Without brand, decisions boiled down to the hard numbers and research coming from marketing and finance. It’s hard to beat those numbers with a mere, “Trust me, this will work.” It’s easy to blame one side or the other for the rough patch in the relationship, but really both sides were 100 percent right in what they were trying to do. They all wanted what was best for Dropbox. The real problem was that there was no organizational structure around how they could build a brand correctly. Perhaps even more importantly, there wasn’t anyone dedicated to educating people about the long-term powers of the brand as a whole.As with all good two-part stories, I must end part one with a cliffhanger.

There’s no room for pathos, window-dressing, staged heroism. Death strips us all bare. We emerge pixel-ized.The blind spots of the Western discourse on Russia and UkraineFor the last month or so, since returning from Ukraine, I’ve hardly written anything. Not because I’ve faced a sudden writer’s block (for that, one has to be a writer — I’m not). Rather, I’m speechless when I see a widening chasm between the mainstream media’s petty interpretations of the Russia-Ukraine war, and the far-reaching historical consequences this war will have globally, for generations to come.From Elon Musk’s Russia appeasement to an ever-louder US left, eager to set limits on the US support of Ukraine ahead of the midterm elections, to China’s Xi Jinping tightening the screws on his already tight grip of power (possibly for life), — the configuration at the global chessboard is one of crossroads: between freedom and autocracy, between the rules-based global order and the law of the jungle, between humanity and cold-blooded profiteering.Republicans are likely to win majority in the upcoming US midterm elections, which calls into question the extent of the future US military aid. The Republican party has been sending mixed signals on how much aid to send to Ukraine, with some far-right commentators openly parroting the Russian narrative that “Russia is actually fighting the West / NATO”.The Republican argument for scaling down the support for Ukraine, — on the basis of fiscal frugality, — is misguided. Economically, the US spends just 0.25% of GDP on the aid to Ukraine (for comparison, Estonia spends 1% of GDP). Politically, scaling back Ukraine’s support package serves neither US national interests, nor the global interest of political and economic stability.The GOP is also ignoring the plain cause-and-effect relation: weaker Ukraine means emboldened totalitarian regimes — from Russia to Iran to China, and almost a century of lost progress towards human rights and greater global stability.The right answer to “How much military aid to send to Ukraine” is simple: “As much as it takes to restore the integrity of Ukraine’s borders.” Any other answer would undermine the commitment to the very global order the democratic world stands for.This past month, there’s been an awful lot of know-it-all opining on “what we should or shouldn’t do” to avert an all-out war between the nuclear powers. A simplistic assertion by Elon Musk, and others without any background on history of Ukraine and Russia, international relations, or game theory—is that averting WW III is a matter of conceding occupied Ukraine’s territories to Russia. This assertion is wrong.Giving in to nuclear blackmail makes nuclear war much more likely. It would significantly increase the chance of any of the other nuclear powers taking advantage of their nuclear status to achieve their political aims. It would also encourage non-nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons for deterrence. Ultimately, it would open the Pandora’s box of global nuclear proliferation.History is a series of “repeated games” — a game theory lingo for facing the same strategic decision multiple times, as opposed to a “one-shot” game, in which counterparts interact once only. However much Putin would like to scare the world into believing this is a one-shot game, — it’s not. That’s why for the more militarily powerful Western allies, it’s irrational to give in to nuclear blackmail by a militarily weaker Russia.Russia threatens to use nukes against Ukraine, not against the Western allies. A likely Western response would be a non-nuclear one (one can successfully use conventional weapons to “take out every Russian conventional force on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea”).Common sense — and its mathematically rigorous counterpart, game theory — suggest that Russian threats are primarily a psychological weapon. Giving in to these threats is neither rational nor peace-forming.Against the backdrop of increasingly polarised US and European politics, it’s perhaps not surprising to hear pro-Russian arguments from both the far-right and far-left. The often-cited reason against increasing the military aid to Ukraine is simply “we’ve got domestic problems to take care of”. Inflation, for one, is top of mind in any developed country right now.The irony, of course, is that Russia’s war in Ukraine is a major driver of the very thing western voters are so weary of — the rising prices of food and fuel. Worse still, dozens of developing countries are at risk of hunger after Russia’s recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain trade deal.The twisted logic in “just stop the war, regardless of the cost to Ukraine” — is that it assumes a long list of Russia-generated problems will simply evaporate once Ukraine surrenders. If one thinks cheap Russian energy will materialise the minute Ukraine is sold out by the allies, one has to revisit the history of two decades of Russian geopolitical adventures — from Caucasus to Transnistria. Russian imperial adventurism is far from limited to Ukraine. Failing to “tame the bear” now, Europe will have to deal with an unlimited supply of geopolitical and energy trouble for decades to come.Should I look beyond food and fuel in my list of reasons to support Ukraine? I’m hardly convinced that world leaders would act out of humanitarian, legal, or moral obligation. Still, let me present these more high-flying arguments in brief.Most western politicking on Ukraine overlooks the dire reality on the ground. Everyone in Ukraine — from Lviv to Zaporizhzhia — would have experienced living without electricity, heat, and water since October 10th. Russia has been destroying the Ukrainian energy system on a daily basis. Meanwhile, civilians have been targeted by Russian missiles programmers since the very start of the war.A cynical observer might argue that it’s human nature — to overlook the moral obligations to strangers far away, and favour helping those close to us. The problem with this argument, of course, is that morality and ethics are universal, and geographically blind.And finally, there is the legal argument. It’s in the infamous Budapest memorandum. In 1994, Ukraine gave up its (third largest in the world) nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from Russia (the irony!), United Kingdom, and the United States. Among other things, the Memorandum prohibits the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine.Persistence: an under-appreciated force in historyThis war has made me a keen student of history. History has taught me to put my faith in persistence rather than in chance.Ukrainians will fight on. We fight to live, not to merely survive.P.S. Thanks for reading!

Perhaps it’s while you’re still lying in bed, using a news feed or social media as the needed stimulant to push you out from under the covers. Or maybe you wait to open your device until after a warm shower and cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, you might say you never signed off in the first place.And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is probably what enabled you to stay in touch with family, or complete entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this sounds familiar, then you live in a part of the world where an internet connection now counts as an essential utility — one that’s as easy to take for granted as the natural gas heating your shower water or the electricity powering your coffee maker.But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally, just over 55% of today’s households have an internet connection. This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is referred to as the digital divide, and access is skewed toward richer nations. The gap is projected to close in the next decade as billions of homes connect to the internet for the first time and by 2030 it’s estimated that the technology industry could account for 20% of the global electricity demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On one hand, it supports livelihoods, educations, and bolsters the global economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps, websites, and services that we build will place an even greater strain on our already-overloaded power grids.These forecasts underscore a big carbon impact for all those pretty pixels and the devices that power them! If you read our previous article, the realization that Digital = Physical is becoming alarmingly clear and this poses our key challenge: how do we enable people from all communities to benefit from increased use of technology, without worsening the polluting and extractive impacts of tech?Microsoft has aggressive climate goals aimed at eliminating our carbon emissions, including emissions from the usage of our products and services. To help both ourselves and the industry begin to navigate the complex landscape of the climate crisis and product development, we recently published our Green Design Principles.The ideas, questions, and actions contained in the Green Design Principles are intended to shine a light on the distance between where we are as an industry and where we aspire to be. They are by no means complete or perfect, but they represent a first step! Microsoft’s Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering training says it well: sustainability isn’t one optimization or inclusive design action, it’s thousands. We recognize that some of the concepts presented here challenge us to reconsider long-standing business conventions or practices, such as attention demanding notifications or growth for the sake of growth.Given the urgency of the climate crisis, we share this in-progress work to gain feedback from the design community. Through a two-part post, we’ll take a deeper dive into these emerging principles, and pose questions and actions so that we might steer our industry toward a more sustainable future.We believe that small changes lead to big changes, everyone has a role to play, and helping promote the discussion about sustainability will empower others to raise their voices. These principles were inspired by and built upon numerous other frameworks, which you can check out at the end of this post.A challenge that digital product makers often face is that the projects they touch are commonly speeding down the road by the time they’re brought in. This can be frustrating for those who have been taught or believe that business follows design, instead of seeing it as a partnership. In reality, the business objectives have already been determined, and the solution needs to be delivered as quickly as possible. Furthermore, there may be minimal budget allocated for deeper design and research, and we may be the only one who has thought once about the environmental sustainability what we’re building.\\n\\nAs we take on the challenge of sparking a sustainable design revolution, we’ll have to think bigger than just pushing design dogma on others, and instead maximize its impact through strategic partnerships and building the connection between sustainability and business success. We’ll need to be intentional about how we nudge entire organizations and systems beyond just user-centered design, and toward a more expansive mindset that brings societal and planetary justice into our decision making.In part one of two below, let’s further explore the how first principle of “Think Bigger Before You Start” asks us to challenge the status quo and put care first.Challenging the status quo means asking the right questions and realizing that the future is indeed changeable. In doing so, we aim to arrive at business practices that are more resilient and restore balance to the systems we are a part of. Here are some possible actions that could help kickstart the process of reprogramming our industry habits.Balance user needs with finite resources — This action prompts us to dispel the illusion that any digital project is infinitely scalable without costs to the finite resources of the environment, mental and physical health of our customers, and society. To draw attention to the depletion of these resources, it helps to ask the following at the onset of new work:These questions merely start the conversation, but could begin to nudge a team away from a ‘growth for growth’s sake’ mentality and feature bloat, and toward a better understanding of users’ core needs — which can result in a competitive edge. Organizations might enjoy financial reward by creating superior tools that complete a focused set of tasks with excellence, rather than building Swiss army knife tools that check many boxes without doing any one thing great.Build on existing knowledge and work — Prior to building something new, what if we looked at what’s already working out there? Rather than building large pieces of a software solution from scratch, or purchasing parts from a supplier, teams should explore the possibility of building upon open-source projects. Choosing to go this route not only avoids the energy spend of duplicative work, but projects with strong communities can lead to more resilient software and help insure against the risk of a single supplier failing.When it comes to helping solve for more acute climate problems, how can we uplift and learn from those that are on the front lines? In the United States, at least 50 indigenous tribes have assessed climate risks and developed plans to tackle them. Their ability to set laws independently of federal or state governments has led to innovative programs around detecting disease in the fish populations that are critical for their nutrition and culture, water management, and more.\\n\\nIn tech we often have a bias toward believing that the code we write is better than code written by others, or the tools our industry provides are the most equipped to solve any problem it encounters in the real world. Put another way, we can often be looking for a problem that fits our solution. When it comes to the climate crisis, we should swim upstream against this habit and instead build tools that embrace work already accomplished by others, tools that allow hyper-local communities to take the lead.\\n\\nMany thanks to the Design Justice Network from which this action is borrowed!Transition alongside our partners — When it comes to sustainability, every company and every customer is at a different stage and it’s important to consider and/or meet people where they’re at. For those who are very early on in their sustainability efforts, it presents an opportunity to bring people along as we move toward more balanced and resilient solutions. If we make an earnest effort in educating and installing incentive structures that reward use of renewable energy or more sustainable business operations, it’s possible that we can turn the tide in a more comprehensive and collaborative fashion.Dig deeper into the metrics and impact — If you base a team’s success and rewards on a singular metric like Daily Active Users or Revenue, they will put their efforts into maximizing it. In many cases, this can result in tactics that are wasteful and create harmful effects on large populations. In all projects, it’s important to pause and ask, “what metric(s) are we basing success on right now and why?”. Further, what other measurements for success could we include to better steer our tactics away from harmful outcomes, and how could we measure if we satisfied the true user need?We should also expand our designs methodologies to consider not just humans, but non-humans. For example, what if we considered the health of rivers, endangered animals, or air quality measurements in how we define our product’s impact?The principle of putting care first might be the easiest one to think about and the hardest one to carry out, especially when business objectives, timelines, or even personalities may work against it. Although it can feel like a constant uphill battle, now more than ever we must exercise our ability to identify the relationships between the things we build and the larger systemic issues that they may uphold.\\n\\nIn the context of the climate crisis, what does it mean to put care first and how can we start to do it?Justice — There’s plenty of lore in Silicon Valley about products that were built in a garage or dorm room, only to take over the world a few years later. While the ‘sole creator’ legend has made for entertaining movies, tech now operates with such ubiquity and scale that there’s much more at stake when we consider the range of outcomes our creations can have. We need to move from a model of designing for people, to designing with people. This means growing beyond usability testing or even customer interviews, to forming deeper working partnerships with communities that are directly and indirectly impacted by the outcome of the design process and the climate impacts it contributes to. One model to reference is the city of Seattle’s community liaison program, which pays representatives of different neighborhood communities to consult directly with city project leaders. The liaisons communicate the needs and feedback of their members, which then is then incorporated into the planning process for major projects such as the building of a new transit station.We must continually assess the power dynamics between our teams and local communities, finding ways to learn with and from them about how our products could do harm or create disadvantages. Building more direct pathways for two-way communication will also enable us to identify if our product ideas are reinforcing economic inequity, systemic racism, or disproportionately negatively affecting marginalized groups.To help get started, check out Microsoft’s resources for Harms Modeling, which provides an assessment matrix with factors such as risk of injury and infringement on human rights. Also, our guide on creating and running Community Juries is helpful in creating a forum where your product team can hear about the perceptions and concerns surrounding the project directly from the external stakeholders that are impacted.Resilience — Climate driven emergencies or disasters are becoming the norm. They might result from extreme record heat waves, wildfires, flooding and drought, tornadoes during the winter, and so on. The impact of these experiences can be very individualized for populations based on where they live, the local infrastructure, and their preparedness levels.Our users will inevitably experience our products differently in times of crisis, and therefore we should start envisioning them being used in such situations. In doing so, we must work to understand the wide range of environmental, emotional, and health scenarios that people might be experiencing at any given time.\\n\\nIn action this means asking:Stay tuned for a second post exploring tactics around building better by default, and please share any thoughts you might have in the comments below!This blog post is a continued discussion on the Green Design Principles which were originally created by the following people who came together to advance the mission of designing for sustainable futures: Abigail Cawley, Aditi Khazanchi, Anna Alfut, Caitlin Esworthy Greene, Chelsea Braun, Connie Huang, Danielle McClune, Emily Lynam, Jennifer Bost, Martyn Gooding, Pragya Gupta, Rachel Bergman, Ryan Hayen, Sandra Pallier, Sarah Shing, Shane Tierney, Shelley Bjornstad, Soumitri Vadali, and Sue Nguyen.Thanks to Projects by IF, a global design company that is redesigning trust in technology, who wrote the original Society Centered-Design manifesto that inspired our thinking.We’d also like to thank the Design Justice Network for their Design Justice Principles, as well as the folks behind Green Software Engineering, Sustainable Service Design, Sustainable Interaction Design, Sustainable Web Design, Digital Earth Experience Principles, and Knowledge Co-Production in Sustainability Research'], ['My Tongue Cancer Story: Gummy Worms, Tomato Soup, and a Grumpy Penguin', 'James Piechota', 'Oct 7', 'https://medium.com/@jamespiechota/my-tongue-cancer-story-gummy-worms-tomato-soup-and-a-grumpy-penguin-4806e86d7a40?source=home---------160------------------0----------', 'A month ago I was diagnosed with tongue cancer. This is my journey of regret, joy, anger, and inter-species body modification.It started about 8 months ago. I like to think of the me from back then as Dr. James, The Idiot. You see, I’m not a doctor, but I am an idiot who made a series of bad health decisions.My tongue started hurting in February, 2022. It felt like a canker sore down the right side of my tongue. When it didn’t go away after a few days, Dr. James, The Idiot stepped in. His diagnosis: fat tongue. All that extra quarantine eating must have gone to my tongue and it couldn’t fit in my mouth anymore. My teeth must be slowly chewing it away while I slept. Treatment: lose that tongue-weight!After thinking really hard about losing weight for a couple weeks, nothing changed. So I started looking for tongue exercises. Then a new thought hit me: What if my tongue got too strong? Surely a jacked tongue wouldn’t help my situation. Heck if my tongue got swole it might make things worse. So I abandoned my plan to do isolated tongue reps, and instead bought a nighttime mouth guard.None of this self-treatment worked. If anything, my tongue hurt more. I had trouble reading to my kids at night, and had to tip my head to the side when eating to make sure nothing scraped the side of my tongue. Finally, almost 3 months after the pain started, I went to my doctor. The first thing he said when he looked in my mouth was: “Hmm… that looks weird. You should see a tongue doctor.” A few days later I saw a tongue doctor (or “otolaryngologist” if you’re feeling fancy). He took a look and said “Hmm… that looks weird. I’m going to give you some paste to try for a few weeks. Just slather it in the crater twice a day. If it doesn’t get better in 3 weeks we’ll take a biopsy.”Wait. “Crater”? I realized that in all this time, these past three months of pain and anxiety, I had never once looked at my tongue. Dr. James, The Idiot had been too afraid of what he’d see. That night I opened my mouth, stuck out my tongue, and sure enough there was a big ole chunk missing. Dr. James was a fool for thinking tongue push ups could fix that.I applied the paste for 3 weeks. The crater did not go away. But Dr. James, The Idiot decided my tongue felt better. So much better that I canceled the biopsy. I then spent another 3 months of pain and wishful thinking before I went crawling back to my otolaryngosaurus for a biopsy.On September 7, 2022, over 6 months after I first felt tongue pain, 5 months after I diagnosed myself with fat-tongue, and 3 months after I declared myself cured, I learned I had tongue cancer.When the doctor called with the results he was very calm. He explained that he thought the tumor in my tongue would respond well to surgery and that they’d do a CT scan to see if the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes. Given its size he was optimistic that the scan would be negative. Without promising anything he thought I could make a full recovery within a couple months, and be speaking normally within a year.All told it was a very “favorable prognosis”.The problem was Dr. James, The Idiot had jumped back in one more time. 4 hours before the otolosangeles called I’d taken a look at the biopsy results on my hospital’s web portal and read:INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, KERATINIZING, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, WITH ULCERATION.Dr. James did not know what those words meant. But he knew anything written in all caps was serious. This wasn’t some shy “uh, excuse me, uh, invasive squamous cell carcinoma”. No, this was serious. ULCERATION! MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED!Dr. James doubled down. He googled “INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA” and found “Skin Cancer Stage 4: the cancerous area has become invasive, spreading to other major parts of the body. Survival rate: 22.5%” By the time my otolarrygeologist called, I had convinced myself I was dying.That night I couldn’t sleep. I kept picturing myself gone. My kids crying. My wife comforting them; raising them; crying alone after they went to sleep. And I kept going over everything I could have done to catch the cancer earlier. I hated Dr. James, The Idiot. I hated myself.My wife is fond of a quote by Victor Hugo: “Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.” I took Mr. Hugo literally. After a dark and sleepless night, the sun rose and I felt better. I remembered the optimism my doctor had and began to quiet the regret and silence Dr. James.Despite months of ignoring pain and avoiding doctors, the cancer was not that advanced, nor that aggressive, and there was a good chance that it would respond well to surgery. I felt incredibly lucky and the next 7 days until my scheduled surgery date were some of the best days I’d had in a while. My life shrank down to a series of pre-operative appointments and spending time with my family. I had lunch dates with my wife, baked with my daughter, and helped coach my son’s soccer team. It was really nice.Over that week I also learned more about the cancer. I learned that the doctor would only describe the size of the tumor as either “more than 50% of my tongue” or “less than 50% of my tongue”. He conceded that it was probably “significantly less than 50%” and was pretty confident that I would be able to speak after the surgery. With time and therapy I would likely sound very similar to how I do now.However my post-cut, weirdly shaped tongue could cause other complications that they wanted to avoid. He would make a game-time decision on whether or not to graft a section of my thigh onto my tongue in order to “smooth it out”. When I told my son this he asked, hopefully, if that would make me a cyborg. I said, no, it would make me a thigh-borg. 😎A couple days before my operation I went into the hospital for a pre-op appointment. This is when things started to get serious. “Don’t eat anything the day of your surgery otherwise you might throw up during surgery and suffocate on your vomit. Don’t put any lotion or cream on your face the day of your surgery otherwise it might catch fire and burn your face off.” Oh crap. I asked… what about deodorant? Should I skip deodorant too so I don’t burn my armpits off? The nurse gave me a quick look — and I swear a quick sniff — and she said “No no, please wear deodorant”.On the day of my surgery I went to the hospital with my stomach empty, my face #NoMakeup, and my armpits smelling like pure sport. I stripped down and put on the gown, trying my best not to flash everyone.First the anesthesiologists came in and got my IV setup. The medical student trying to get my IV in was having some trouble. As the attending physician was talking the med student through it he, very smoothly, picked up my phone and put it in his pocket. At first I didn’t know what to do. Finally I interrupted him and said “Uh, excuse me… uh… I think that’s my phone?” He took it out of his pocket, looked surprised and handed it back. “Haha,” he said, “All these phones look the same. But I was pretty smooth, wasn’t I? You barely even saw me do it!” I laughed extra hard because this guy was about to put me asleep and I really wanted to wake up.Next the surgeon came in, made sure I was all set, and signed my face.They rolled me into the operating room and I fell asleep. When I woke up, my thigh was shaved, my tongue was covered in bandages, and I had tubes coming out of my neck. For the next couple days I tried to sleep as much as I could. Once the anesthesia started to wear off I grabbed my phone and used the camera as a mirror. It wasn’t pretty. My camera app agreed, and suggested I might get a better shot if I used portrait mode. It didn’t help.The incision on my neck was pretty badass though. The cut goes from my ear all the way down the side of my neck. It follows the path some tough guy might trace with his thumb when he’s threatening to kill someone. So now whenever I see someone do that “you’re dead” move all I can picture is them saying “I’m gonna cut out your lymph nodes and cure your cancer, asshole. By the time I’m done with you, punk, you’re gonna be so cured, you won’t even know you were sick.”I learned that the tumor they removed from my tongue was 3.7cm x 1.3cm x 0.9cm, or about half the size of a gummy worm. The flap of skin they took from my thigh was 4cm x 8cm x 0.5cm, about the size of one of those Trader Joe’s fruit leathers. And finally they removed 23 lymph nodes, or about 23 frozen peas. So half a gummy worm, a strip of fruit leather, and 23 peas. I know what I’m handing out for Halloween this year!I was in the hospital for 2 days, and before they could discharge me they had to show me how to give myself blood thinner injections. The nurse told me to grab some of my stomach about 2 inches away from my belly button. She said the most important part when putting the needle in was not to go too deep. I had to stay in fat and not hit muscle. But then she looked at my pinch of stomach fat, and added “But I don’t think you need to worry about that.”When I got home everything was harder. My tongue hurt, my neck hurt, my thigh hurt. It hurt to talk. It hurt to eat. It hurt to sleep. I was under strict orders not to exert myself, but I barely had the energy to walk across the room. I wrestled with a fever that came and went. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with blood dripping from my mouth staining my pillow.It was sincerely awesome.Every time I struggled to do something simple, I got to celebrate when I succeeded. Never in my life had the bar been set so low! My wife almost cried when she realized I could speak. When I put on shorts instead of pants and realized they didn’t rub my thigh graft painfully, I felt like the smartest man in the neighborhood. My kids cheered the first time I finished a bowl of cream of wheat. And everyone was way too excited the first time I showered.It wasn’t all roses. I was limited to a “full liquid diet”. Which meant I could only eat things that were drinkable or almost drinkable (tomato soup, pudding, cream of wheat) — and definitely no breads or baked goods. My daughter loves to bake, but hates to waste food, so she has assigned me an important role I take quite seriously: baked goods trash can. It’s my responsibility to make sure everything is finished before she bakes again. And for weeks of my recovery I couldn’t do my job. In completely unrelated news, I’ve lost over 10 pounds since my surgery.And, woo boy, are there a lot of tomato soups! It’s amazing! There’s your classic, your creamy, and your bisque. Maybe a little tomato basil soup or roasted red pepper for an extra treat. And the Cadillac of tomato soup: Campbell’s black-label slow kettle tomato bisque.After a hard day’s work of showering and wearing shorts, I’d kick back with a bowl of Black Label and a warm mug of beef broth.Roughly a week after my surgery I went back to see my doctor so he could remove my tongue bandages. To do this he had to poke around my mouth a bit to snip the stitches that were holding the dressing to my tongue. My wife was in the room for moral support. To give you a sense of my pain tolerance, she noticed that I cried while the doctor was cutting the sutures. Only a little bit though. A single tear rolled down my cheek. Which is pretty damn poetic if you ask me.During this meeting the doctor said that the skin graft wasn’t “taking” as well as he’d like. It would probably be fine, but he’d like to add something called “Integra” to help. Integra is a material that they sew onto my tongue to help it grow back. It is made from “bovine tendon collagen and shark glycosaminoglycans”. In other words once I got this grafted to my tongue I would be part-cow, part-shark, all thigh-borg. I would be unstoppable!After I got home with my newest graft, a few of the sutures were poking my mouth, so I asked my doctor if I could cut them off. He said sure, just use scissors. Dr. James was back in action! I struggled for half an hour, but eventually was able to snip off two of the protruding sutures without cutting my tongue. I was so stoked I sent my surgeon a message:He did not respond.Perhaps the highlight of this whole journey happened a few days ago when I was able to start having solid food again. That first peanut butter and jelly sandwich was heaven. For the rest of the day whenever anyone asked how I was doing I just said “I ate a sandwich!”I started writing this post shortly after I got home from the hospital. It’s now been a few weeks and I’m having trouble finishing it. Physically I’m doing pretty good. I shower daily. I wear pants. I eat sandwiches whenever I want. Regular life has returned and the stream of little joys have dried up. Getting out of bed in the morning isn’t a show of strength. Carrying a conversation with my daughter isn’t an achievement. Cooking dinner and cleaning the kitchen is no longer an empowering step back to independence.And I’m angry. Not at anything in particular. Just angry. The sort of anger that makes me sit and frown like that penguin picture.If I were 16, I’d probably put on some 90’s Pop Punk and run my anger out. But at 41 that doesn’t work anymore (I tried).The anger bleeds out. My 7-year old daughter refuses to eat cereal for breakfast because she says the lactose-free milk still gives her a stomach ache, and I irrationally tell her “Fine, you make breakfast for the family next time.”It’s a stupid anger. I know it’s stupid. I really have nothing to be angry about. I have a good life. My family is healthy. I don’t worry about money. I know this. But still I’m angry at nothing and everything. I’m angry at myself for being angry.A few days ago I learned that the cancer isn’t completely gone. They detected something called a “Perineural invasion”. I don’t quite understand it. My doctor tried to explain. It’s something like a really small amount of cancer on my neurons. Not a problem yet, but that baby cancer might grow up and start a new tumor. And the neuron acts like a phone line or something so they don’t know where the new tumor could pop-up. I guess it’s like some kind of baby cancer making a phone call to a big daddy cancer. Maybe?I will likely need radiation therapy. I have an appointment with a Radiation Oncologist next week when I’ll learn more about the treatment and side effects.I’d like to blame my anger on this new development. Just me trying to cope with a new worry. Me being frustrated that I’m not out of the woods yet.But this isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way. In fact this whole process has played out before. The first time was about 15 years ago when I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s is a chronic condition with occasional “flares”. When you’re in a flare you have to poop. A lot. Maybe 10–15 times a day. Often with high “urgency” — like hold onto your butt and run to a toilet fast.I was in that first flare for about 6 months. At its worst I lost about 45 pounds — a quarter of my body weight — in a month. I organized my whole day around access to bathrooms. I’d plan ahead for any trip or business meeting. Sometimes I’d get dizzy and fall because my muscles were weak and my iron was low.But, just like with the tongue cancer, I had a lot of good memories of that time. As the doctors narrowed in on the right medicine, I was able to eat more. My strength started coming back. Each day was a little better than the one before. I celebrated every pound of weight I put back on. I was almost giddy with excitement the first time I was able to take a trip to the local mall. And the first time I slept through the night without having to run to the toilet felt like I had superpowers. Every day was simple. There were challenges to overcome and I was chipping away at them. I didn’t care about next year or even next week. I was singularly focused on making it through each day without crapping my pants.Eventually my flare ended. And regular life returned. Everything was easier, but also harder. And I remember feeling anger then too. And being angry at myself for being angry. My life back then was good. I had no reason to be angry. But still I was.Being happy when I have a life-threatening illness, and angry once I’ve recovered? That’s some self-destructive bullshit.So here I am again. I have a wonderful, healthy family without major money worries.. All things considered, I’m remarkably healthy. I’ve had two life-altering illnesses and it’s looking like both of them will at worst be chronic conditions I can manage without too much pain. I am lucky. But I am still angry. And I don’t know why.So I’m taking one more note from Dr. James, The Idiot: I’m going to stop trying to think my way out of this. I’m getting Radiation Therapy for the baby cancer, and Speech Language Therapy to teach my thigh-borg how to talk again. And now I’ve added straight up therapy to help with my angry penguin problem. The journey isn’t over, but the future’s looking good.Thank you for reading my story! I want to give a shout out to Family Reach. They’re a an awesome organization working to help families afford cancer care — including all the unexpected costs that can come up during treatment and recovery.'], ['My Hearing Loss Is Also My Gain', 'Jillian Enright', 'Apr 28', 'https://aninjusticemag.com/deaf-culture-and-deaf-gain-4bf46db4fa0a?source=home---------252------------------0----------', '“Use your voice when you talk to him,” a parent asks — no, directs me.I am at Deaf camp.

I love discovering when the words aren’t doing what they should be — I love improving products! But, I hate that sometimes I sense my peers don’t have any particular feedback — they’ll either remain silent or say something like “looks good!” This feedback is very hard to build on. My hypothesis about what happens is that people are looking for flaws and if they can’t find any, they forget to give praise about what was done well.I’m here to ask you to praise your peers because the silence is deafening when you don’t. And, it’s much easier to repeat something done well than to find a quick fix for something that doesn’t work.Giving praise can be as simple as saying “I like your use of the color plum.”This sentence signals praise at the start, and goes beyond the superficial with tangible evidence. In one fell swoop, it acknowledges praise, the effort that goes into decision-making, and a specific decision.I learned this schema when I worked for a program that paired college students with preschool kids to encourage fundamental learning and social skills. Our goal was to build up the child’s confidence by asking them to explore and seek validation from themselves. Healthy design teams have a similar goal in my opinion — to encourage growth among peers.I find the five principles from Alexia Dellner’s article “Stop Saying ‘Good Job’ to Your Kids (and What to Say Instead)” really inspiring. They’re based on research by the University of Florida and Columbia University, and they taught me that you can give praise that has an impact and builds a healthier culture around critique.Give someone a specific example of how they did well. This makes it easy to repeat that behavior in the future, and get the same positive outcome. Try starting this type of praise with “I like how you…” or “I admire it when you…”It takes months, sometimes years, to build a product. Yet, the end result is a product of the process. That’s why there’s a higher value in commenting on the effort and process. Instead of “great job getting your project done,” you might try saying, “you must have worked so hard and managed your time well to meet this tight deadline!”Consider, for example, that praise about the visual attractiveness of a design can easily lack value when it’s based on a subjective opinion or immovable requirements like your brand’s design language. Praise what’s within someone’s power like the effort, generosity, and attitude that they put into the work.I often worry that the praise I get from my coworkers will dry up if my strengths and knowledge in a particular subject don’t translate to other projects. But, what I try to remember is that I actually control and want to be praised for how I approach problems and create spaces for people to share ideas. I don’t always need to be the subject matter expert.A simple, evaluation-free statement lets someone know that you noticed. It allows them to take pride in what they did and gives them a moment to expand on what you’re seeing. Remember to be specific, so your statement has depth for the receiver.Allow someone to decide for themselves how they feel about their accomplishments by asking questions. Doing this allows someone to reward themselves, and encourages them to internalize what they observed about their own efforts. You could uncover a fascinating conversation by asking, “what was the hardest part to design?” or “I’d love to learn from your process, how did you approach this problem?”“Good job” or “looks good” can be an attempt to show appreciation for someone. Try a simple “thank you for being here” or a more verbose “your many-folded brain makes our products better.” This shows someone that their whole self has value.Creating moments to celebrate your peers’ work is vital to a psychologically safe environment, builds a culture of curiosity, and allows people to recognize what they do well. It’s the most powerful thing I’ve found to create a positive impact on the culture of my team.

Wars have been fought over it — Pearl Harbor was a preemptive strike to secure Japanese access to Indonesian oil — and it elevated desert tribes to the ranks of the wealthiest cohorts in history. But the sun has passed midday on oil’s supremacy. We’ve moved from an oil economy to an attention economy.We used to refer to an information economy. But economies are defined by scarcity, not abundance (scarcity = value), and in an age of information abundance, what’s scarce? A: Attention. The scale of the world’s largest companies, the wealth of its richest people, and the power of governments are all rooted in the extraction, monetization, and custody of attention.Commercial exploitation of attention is not new. Humans have been competing for attention since the days when nomadic leaders argued over which branch of the river to follow and turning “content” into wealth since Aeschylus produced the Oresteia. Oil was elevated by the invention of the internal combustion engine, industrial revolutions in mechanization and plastics, and the development of a Western lifestyle dependent on the mobility of goods and humans. Now the shift from atoms to bits — digitization — has put wells into pockets, on car dashboards, and on kitchen counters, drilling night and day for … attention.The largest companies by revenue are still mostly oil companies, but the most valuable companies are mostly attention-seeking enterprises — Big Tech holds 4 of the top 5 spots. From Apple to Amazon, Facebook to Fox News, Twitter to TikTok, tech and media companies are the sheikhs and wildcatters finding and capping our attention. And, just as in the rise of the oil economy … there will be blood.There are more players in the attention economy than just the tech and media giants. Podcasting is a high-growth, low-barrier-to-entry opportunity for newcomers to harvest attention, and (for about 1% of them) to convert it to wealth. Conferences are a nice business of in-person attention harvesting. Substack has spurred a modest revival of the email newsletter, Salesforce paid $30 billion for Slack’s command of workplace attention, and Spotify is leveraging our music listening attention into a platform for all media.Conferences, newsletters, and even music streaming are all artisan projects, bit players in the shadow of the supermajors. Even a mega-conference like the 130,000-strong Comic Con is a sub-2.0 flutter on the Richter scale of the broader attention economy. The biggest players measure monthly active users in hundreds of millions.However, the attention economy is defined by disruption, and even the giants are susceptible. If Facebook is Exxon and Netflix Shell, TikTok is fracking king Chesapeake Energy, the rule-breaking insurgent armed with novel extraction methods that threaten the established order. Like oil, attention must be extracted, processed, and monetized. Disruption occurs when innovators re-architect the attention economy value chain.Pre-digital attention entrepreneurs drilled for attention with interesting or entertaining content such as a newspaper or TV show, and monetized it through subscriptions and ads. The first wave of innovation was driven by the infinite capacity of digital storage and distribution: the bottomless well of choice. Netflix rose to dominance by cracking a gusher of classic sitcoms and rewatchable movies. More commercial-free content extracted more attention. By 2016 that was enough to make Netflix bigger than the entire industry it supplanted, cable TV. But the scale was linear, with few network effects.Social media brought two major innovations. The first was to offload content production, and its cost, onto the user. No matter how efficient Netflix gets at producing shows in multiple languages, or how shamelessly Disney milks its existing IP, their economics are dwarfed by TikTok or YouTube, where consumers build the content drill rigs that the platforms monetize.Next, the social media companies broadened the very notion of what content could be. Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit feature “content” in the traditional sense, but they turn the emissions (users’ comments) into content that’s still more valuable (addictive even) as it has more emotional resonance. By emotional resonance I mean they satisfy a deep need for others’ approval or they enrage us. The comments/replies, the pissing match, the rapidly brigaded insanity is what mines attention and emotion. It’s as if Exxon found a way to make heroin out of exhaust. Connecting the world has augured a simple question: Should we be this connected without having a commensurate presence? You’d never say (much of) this shit to people in person. And anonymity enables fake accounts and bad actors, which platforms tolerate so they can profit from greater noxious emissions.While the sewer of ad-driven social media enragement was contaminating the water table, a new innovator arrived. TikTok is remixing the attention economy value chain. The short-form video platform relies on the economics of user-generated content, but it takes a narrower, less “social” approach to delivery.Netflix rose on the back of infinite choice. Choice, however, comes with a hidden cost: the cognitive work of choosing. TikTok asks less of its consumers than any platform since broadcast television. Open the app, and a video starts playing. A single swipe at the end of every video tees up the next one. An algo watches how long you watch, what you watch to the end, and whether you like or follow, and manicures a streaming network that is singular. You can get more involved, following individual creators and even responding, but the app is built around a passive experience. TikTok’s recombination of attention economy capabilities makes it the new apex predator: The app commands more attention per user than Facebook and Instagram combined. And among teens it’s catching up to the passive king itself, television.Fossil fuel’s externalities are now well understood. An economy built on burning carbon has had a catastrophic impact on the planet. The advent of fracking led to huge profits and a recalibration of the oil economy, but at increased cost: flammable water, earthquakes, and chemical leaks.Though it’s wrapped in dance and dog videos, TikTok comes with many of the problems linked to algorithmically generated content and platforms. A Wall Street Journal investigation found new accounts registered as belonging to 13- to 15-year-olds would veer down “rabbitholes” of sex- and drug-related videos in just days, simply by lingering on initial, tamer videos with those themes. And TikTok comes with an additional, unique externality: its links to the Chinese Communist Party. The potential risks in that relationship have been recognized by our last two presidents. I’m particularly concerned with the propaganda potential of the platform.To be clear, there is no evidence the CCP has manipulated content to undermine American interests. What is also clear: A headjack installed on America’s youth, who spend more time on TikTok than any other network, that connects them to a neural network that may be shaped by the CCP is a risk we cannot tolerate. If the product cannot be separated from the ownership (e.g., spun off or acquired by Western firm), I believe the app should be banned. Putting the term “ban” so close to the term “media” justifiably raises concerns. An easier argument may be that we should have a reciprocal approach with China re media businesses. (See above: Ban TikTok.)It was a theme sounded by others at the Code conference. When I asked Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner for his thoughts on TikTok, I expected a watered-down “we’re watching them” nothing-burger response. (That’s the protocol for a public company CEO.) Instead: “It is of course a tool of espionage … TikTok should be banned in every democracy.” There are signs of momentum: rumored regulations that could result in a ban, and calls for app store bans from FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr. We banned Russian oil, why not Chinese (potential) propaganda? Others see it differently: After I spoke about the issue on Bill Maher last week, several prominent tech journalists said my TikTok rant was distracting us from the real issues in the industry, including privacy and data reform. But this isn’t a zero-sum shitstorm. Big Tech offers us more than one threat, and I’ve been warning about those posed by Facebook and other platforms for years. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.Is TikTok the ultimate evolution of the attention-economy titans? Everyone else in the attention economy is acting like it. Original content is out. CNN+ was unplugged; Netflix is churning subscribers and has shed 70% of its market cap; households are canceling cable and streaming subscriptions in record numbers; and two tech platforms that tried to launch their own original content streaming services just threw in the towel: YouTube Originals shut down in January, and Snap Originals followed in August.Instead, everyone is trying to outTik the Tok. Netflix launched “Fast Laughs,” Instagram introduced “Reels,” YouTube brought out “Shorts,” Snap did “Spotlight,” Roku is trying “The Buzz,” Pinterest launched “Watch” … even Twitter is exploring a TikTok-like product. I think they should call it Vine. Just a thought.Internal documents at Meta reveal that users spend less than a tenth of the time watching Instagram Reels as they do watching TikTok. Reels engagement is in fact falling, perhaps because a third of the videos on the platform are created on a different platform (usually TikTok, complete with watermark). Meta has tried to algorithmically “downrank” these videos so they receive less traction, but they remain pervasive. Users are actively resisting these product changes. After Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner spread a meme asking Meta to “Make Instagram Instagram Again,” a petition gained, at last count, 312,000 signatures. The petition will fall on (Mark’s) deaf ears. Meta is not innovative (see Oculus and fever dreams of a legless hellscape), just the fastest follower in social. Note: Many who pushed back on my calls to break up Meta and let the market do its job have an increasingly strong argument, as the company’s stock is at a five-year low.TikTok’s short-term dominance at the front end of the attention extraction business won’t be stopped by anyone who doesn’t hear “Hail to the Chief” every time they walk into a room. However, if you check this space five years from now, will TikTok still be a supermajor in the attention economy? If the answer is no, I’d posit that the likely dragon reigning over, and defending, Kings Landing will be YouTube.Fifty-six percent of Americans watch YouTube on a daily or weekly basis. Ninety-five percent of teens use the platform, compared to a third who use Facebook and two-thirds who use TikTok. Back in 2019, YouTube disclosed that users were uploading more than 500 hours of footage to the site every minute, a number that’s likely much higher today. Last year the platform generated almost $29 billion in advertising revenue — roughly equal to Netflix’s total revenue.As with so much in business and biology, diversity is key. Oil can be found in the desert, under the sea, or in the tundra, and extracting it from each ecosystem demands a unique skillset. Likewise, refiners convert crude into gasoline, natural gas, lubricants, and aspirin. No attention-economy player has the diversity of YouTube. Videos can be as short as one second or as long as 12 hours. Some are user-generated, others are studio-produced. (In fact, the second half of my Bill Maher appearance was produced specifically for YouTube.)You can socialize (argue) with people in the comment section, or you can just use it as you would a streaming platform. More and more people turn to YouTube for more and more reasons: home improvement projects, makeup advice, music videos, product reviews, etc. You can load up infinite videos on a topic or from a creator, subscribe to your favorites, or just let the recommendation algo take over. While it depends on user content, YouTube isn’t passively waiting for that content to arrive. The company’s strategic partnership managers advise about 12,000 creators. According to a senior director, if a YouTube star doesn’t post once week, their manager is “likely to know why.”YouTube’s kevlar is its betweenness, especially on the creator end. Users can get their start with low-production vlogs and selfie videos — just as they do on TikTok. However, as your following grows, the scale of your production can grow with you, bringing longer videos, broadcast-quality camera crews and performers, and increased costs commensurate with revenue. A prime example of this is YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, otherwise known as MrBeast. MrBeast started making cheap gaming videos and commenting on YouTube dramas.As his YouTube subscriber base grew, so did Donaldson. Today, MrBeast creates formidable productions with reinvested earnings. His most popular video, a real-life reenactment of Squid Game, cost $3.5 million to produce (the cost of an episode of Mad Men). It received 300 million views. This is the sort of content that currently doesn’t happen on TikTok, whose specialized attention-extraction tech has a much more limited range. Now, Donaldson is refining his attention to offline energy, with a burger restaurant (it drew 10,000 fans opening day) and cloud kitchen venture.Any massive increase in wealth over a short period is accompanied by externalities. There is no free lunch. OK, maybe caffeine. The externalities are typically opaque, and the parties best able to address them early are incentivized to create weapons of mass distraction to delay and obfuscate while they achieve economic security for themselves and their families. It’s also clear that the longer the externality runs unfettered, the more damage is done and (exponentially) greater the cost to address the issue. TikTok’s COO, Vanessa Pappas, didn’t wrap herself in glory at this week’s congressional hearings. She was over-consulted by her comms team and claimed that ByteDance has no headquarters, as it’s “a distributed company.” Despite the awesome news that there’s a new class of firm we can legitimately call a DisCo, being full of shit only fosters additional resentment against the company, and the uncomfortable link it’s forged between the CCP and the emotions and beliefs of a rising generation of American citizens.This shouldn’t distract us from the (still) clear and present danger American platforms present to our privacy, teens’ mental health, and our less and less civil discourse. The leaders of American media platforms don’t suffer from immorality but amorality — indifference and dissonance about the damage their companies do. When it’s raining money, your vision gets blurred.An autocratic government that seeks to diminish America’s standing and way of life is, in my view, immoral. There is evidence that the CCP has used, and will continue to use, all assets at its disposal to undermine U.S. interests domestically and abroad. TikTok should be spun to Western investors or treated the way China treats American platforms: kicked out.Life is so rich,P.S. We could all stand to be more productive.

I hope they might help you on your creative journey.The value of good typography within the discipline of graphic design cannot be understated. Type can make or break everything else and knowing how to wield typography effectively can separate good work from great work. When it comes to typography, designers need to be good at two things: typeface selection and typeface usage within a design itself. Good typeface selection requires that you know what good typefaces are and where to find them.A contemporary graphic designer must care deeply about type and, like a record collector, must have good taste and know the nuances and interrelatedness between the subject matter being designed and a typeface and type system that is most applicable and expressive for the purpose at hand. Great contemporary type foundries such as Pangram Pangram, Blaze, Displaay, General Type Studio, Florian Karsten, Edition.studio are just a handful of small type foundries that do not get enough credit for the craft required to develop typefaces that allow a great design solution to be brought to life by a capable graphic designer. Without great type designers we do not have great graphic designers.There are timeless typefaces (Garamond, Helvetica), trendy typefaces (remember when Brown was all the rage?) and everything in between. And what is fresh and not overused today will be no longer fresh and overused tomorrow. Keeping on top of your ability to utilize type both compositionally, creatively, and legibly while also having a passion and awareness for new faces coming out is crucial.In the funny recent John Mayer interview with Kerwin Frost (skip to 25:10 in) Mayer talks about how free fonts are “bullshit” and that when you see a free font used on a record cover or site you can tell. John goes on to say that spending the money on a great typeface is about investing in quality and when you use a substandard free typeface “your brain doesn’t know it but your heart can tell.” I’m not terribly familiar with Mr. Mayer’s musical oeuvre, but I am happy to see someone that produces popular music with a broad appeal encapsulate why great typography matters when you are making things that go out in the world that do cultural work like music. As John says; “Just buy the font!.”I have found that every designer has their own personal taste that informs how they approach design. Your taste is the product of your experiences as well as the depth and breadth of your inspirations and influences. One’s personal taste is not always the right sensibility for every client project, so the challenge is to leverage your own taste while also understanding what good taste is for the work you are doing. Personal taste is impossible to teach: it comes from how you see the world.Good taste in the context of the design discipline is one’s ability to bring beauty and sophistication to a design approach while also making it right for the client’s needs and making it resonate in a way that is considered contemporary and stunning at this moment in time. You need to do this while also using your personal taste as a filter. This dance between what you like, what the world of good design right now looks like, and what is right for the client is unique for every designer. Solving this complex equation simply requires good taste which can only be found through your own creative curiosity and will.That said, it helps to be around other designers that have good taste. Working alongside very talented people will encourage you to push your own abilities and your Ways of Seeing. You have to be a good observer and a good curator of your own aesthetic impulses. When I think of good taste, I immediately think of the Italian fashion entrepreneur Alessandro Squarzi. Mr Squarzi has good taste and you can see by his Instagram how he is able to combine a complex cultural vocabulary that mixes Pitti Uomo vibes with American vintage and military all wrapped up in his own personal aesthetic. His good taste is the product of a lifetime in fashion honing his craft. Graphic designers seek this same level of aesthetic balance and it is something you can only learn by being relentlessly inspired. As a brand example, I consider Manual Creative’s work for Stava and Athletics’ work for Citrix as exemplary examples of good taste at work. Both projects show a level of sophistication, restraint and a reverence for the client and their mission that only comes from having a firm handle on how to wield good taste to bring a great brand to life.If there is anything I have learned about business in the last 25 years is that not everyone wants to lead projects. Leading is a big responsibility, and there are always a great deal of unknowns. It can be scary, and on top of that when you lead, people assume that you have the right answer, which is often not the case. A metaphor I use is imagining a good leader to be like a guide in the woods. An experienced guide is better than an inexperienced one, but there is no guarantee that you will not make a wrong turn or get lost. The leader is working to find the right path out of the proverbial creative woods even if it requires a detour, repelling off of a cliff, or running from bears. In this way, a good leader facilitates and provides direction while also taking on accountability for the project outcome.When it comes to design for me there is a simple difference that grows in your mind when you want to be a leader; you go from wanting to “make” something specific to wanting to “solve” something larger. Making something is fun. When you “make” there is no right or wrong answer. I love making things. I love exploring ideas. But this is different from being driven to solve a larger problem and leading. As a true project leader you are trying to arrive at the right solution through the making of the team. You are working to identify all of the contingencies and potential pitfalls. Why is this important? Well, when doing a project for money you have to get to an end point where the client feels they have received what they paid for and the team has to feel they have done their job to the best of their ability. Real leaders are making sure this outcome is always top of mind every step of the way.I think that some people are more wired to lead than others and I would put them into two groups. One group is the kind of person that gets a biography on the History Channel, a person that is very passionate and driven about an idea and is often very self-involved and weird. There are countless leaders that we can name where talent, vision and personal hubris are all blended into one. These are the kind of people that are often seen as larger-than-life. To be honest, I’m not really into this kind of leader archetype because it puts one person in the spotlight as the sole author, which as we all know is total BS. To do great things takes more than one person’s vision, and I think it is an unfair and biased assumption to believe one person has all the answers. It discounts all the other folks making the project happen and doing the hard work.The other kind of leader is driven to be in service of the work and the idea and not by their ego. Everyone who leads wants to solve problems, but the great leaders are the ones that never tire of the journey to get there. I have had the great fortune to work with a handful of people that are brilliantly creative and a few of those people are also leaders. The creative leaders I know that are exceptional are able to masterfully balance their craft of making with the many dependencies that leadership requires to solve bigger problems. They are both creator and manager. Maker and solver. Leader and soldier. I truly admire this type of leader because they remain close to the work and know the sweat and pain that is required to bring great things to life. For those interested in learning about a designer’s journey as a leader I highly recommend the Frequencies podcast: Unity without Uniformity with Gretel’s Head of Design Dylan MulvaneyAs you grow as a designer, you will come to find that your work will not speak for itself as much as you hope it will. Other people are not you and they will always have their own interpretation of what is presented. As humans we see the world through our own lens of preferences and experiences which makes the whole world of aesthetics quite subjective. When you are developing brands this subjectivity can be very frustrating.Someone, a client for example, may not have the same caliber of good taste as you and may fall in love with an idea that you feel is not as good as the idea you have. The only way to resolve this subjective preference is through written and verbal argument. You have to be able to show a client how their subjective preferences will negatively impact the outcome of the project. If you do not do this then it is just a subjective discussion about personal taste and you will agree to disagree and there will be a stalemate.This is a really important thing to understand — you have to be able to convince non-visual people to appreciate and understand the verbal rationalization of your creative work so that they can see your thinking in the work itself. You must show them the light and you must not only convince them your idea is better, you must also explain how your idea ties into business goals and the bottom line. As a graphic designer you have to be able to do this verbally in a meeting, in short form for a presentation, and in long form as an email. I have found that this is the only way to ensure that your idea that may not be subjectively preferred will be understood as the objectively superior solution.I have spent literally thousands of hours in front of the computer working on design things. Hours upon hours fussing with type, adjusting keyframes, rendering, making a million different logo versions — you name it. I have largely done this kind of work alone or with headphones on shutting out the outside world. This deep work was something that only solitude could afford me and it has been indispensable in getting better at my craft. The fewer distractions I have had the more I have learned.Over the years I have found that solitary work is only good up to a certain point. You can go too deep and turn into a creative version of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now if you don’t have other people to bounce ideas off of. Collaboration means to work together, but it also means to “labor with.” As a designer, we are never really “working together” as much as we are laboring alongside one another toward a common goal. We are supporting each other in our individual isolation to work through an idea and we are seeking solace and guidance from each other in our struggle to make something really good.Many years ago I had a creative partner, exceptionally talented, but they had to do things their way no matter what anyone said. They had to take a path and I had to let them fail or succeed on their terms and in their own time. I wanted more than anything to give them “the answer” but they always had to find it themselves, even if it was the same place I wanted to go. I found this to be incredibly frustrating, but years later I realized that even though we were supposedly working together we were really laboring alongside one another and it was as meaningful to just be there on the sidelines as support and as a cheerleader instead of giving answers.I’m a design fan. Always have been. What has remained the most captivating to me, be it design, illustration or art, is the work itself. I’m always drawn to creative work that inspires me and goads me to work harder and be better. As you grow in your career you meet fellow designers and may become a member of any number of design organizations like AIGA or D&AD. These organizations can be a great way to make connections and possibly win awards. These are all good things, but like a juicy Twitter thread, they can take up a lot of time when you probably should be designing.The metaphor I like to use is that being a race car driver is very different from being a member of a race car fan club. Creative agencies are like race car companies, they are designed for performance. Design organizations are more like fan clubs, they are designed to support and celebrate the output of agency work. I have certainly been a design groupie, wanting to meet some of my design heroes at a conference or speaking engagement, but this is a very temporal thing. Ultimately the most meaningful and lasting creative relationships I have had have been through working on projects or though deeper interactions with my design colleagues cultivated over years.It’s totally okay to be a design super fan, but your own work should come first. Spending too much of your energy “in the scene,” be it online or in person, can be immediately fulfilling but it is not a replacement for making work and improving your skills. Without great creative work you are just a spectator.Among some designers there is also a visceral desire to be validated by your peers. Reaching for the design limelight can be a fleeting exercise and being a design celebrity, whatever that means, is a tricky thing to want to be. Wanting popularity by its nature is kind of selfish and odd and is often a byproduct of something within you that is not about the actual work you create. Wanting your work to be recognized and appreciated is a natural thing to want, but it is only through doing great work that you can gain that recognition. In addition to great work, there are a number of other factors that might come into play — being at the right place at the right time, doing something for a person or organization in culture that is highly popular and getting that “afterglow,” luck, marketing, etc. To seek out creative validation can often come off as self serving or insincere. Appreciating it when it comes is a sweeter reward. Just remember that the work is the thesis. Taking the time to do amazing work is hard and is the only true path. The rest will follow.As a designer, understanding the bigger picture of an industry and the goals and needs of your client specifically is crucial and serves as an important input to make better creative decisions. Here is a simple example: If a direct competitor to your client uses blue as a primary brand color maybe you should not use blue, even if you really like blue. You would not know to make this color decision unless you knew who the direct competitor to your client was. Context is the key to helping you make this informed creative decision. Context also helps designers to avoid designing in a vacuum and can give you the information a client’s CEO and CMO need to hear so that they can rationalize your creative solution and agree that it is an appropriate one. This sounds like common sense, but it is surprisingly uncommon. Designers get caught up in the making and can overlook something very practical, either in the work itself, or in the industry the client serves, that can negatively impact or even negate a great idea in the eyes of the client. Remember to do your homework and be able to succinctly articulate the challenges of the industry or category of your client, the specific things your client needs to solve, and how your design decisions solve these problems.My latest go-to for great industry context and insight is the email newsletter Off Kilter written by veteran brand strategist and former Head of Strategy at Wolff Olins New York Paul Worthington. Paul is passionate about his work and equally passionate about understanding the larger trends and decisions happening in business that impact global brands. Off Kilter is very smart and rye and provides a compact distillation of some of the bigger movements happening in business as it relates to brand.How you bill for design work has never been a perfect formula. There are many factors. The three questions I always ask myself is “will it make you rich?”, “will it make you famous?” or “will it make you happy?” I have found that if you are not happy at the end of the project, the other two factors don’t matter as much.Happiness is the end goal for every project, but money does matter. Exchanging creative services for a competitive fee creates a contractual formality that encourages both parties to play by the rules and to respect one another more. If you are charging what your time and expertise are truly worth, you and your team will put in the extra level of effort to deliver, and the client will expect that same level of effort from you and respect the work you create.On occasion I have done work for less money because I really wanted to do the project. But in doing this, more often or not, I became dissatisfied and there was a little voice in my head feeling that they should be more appreciative and accept ideas “as is” because they were getting a deal. This put me in the wrong mindset to do my best work and opened up both parties to more subjective and emotional decision making. I have found that it is almost impossible to do great work for someone else if economically you feel you are being taken advantage of and if the client feels they are getting a deal.Never stop learning and never stop making mistakesLearning new skills is as fundamental as talent. We are forever students. The fundamentals of design are timeless, but the creative industry is always changing. As culture, technology, and our society evolves, so does the work of the designer. There is a kind of unspoken Moore’s Law about design. I believe design advances in a noticeable way about every 18 months keeping pace with software and business processes.Along with change comes making mistakes. You have to do a lot of wrong to get to what’s right. I don’t think there are any short cuts. Embracing change and making mistakes is at least fifty percent of a designer’s job. The sooner you realize this and embrace it the more fun your work can be. You can’t fight change. You have to accept it and lean into it. I would rather see someone try a weird new idea and fail than just show me something I’ve seen before. I’m always excited when someone shows me a new piece of software or a new trend in process. The closer we get to what we think is right the further it moves away from us. It is this forward momentum that keeps things fresh, new, and energized.Hard Work Pays OffI’m not a Crossfit person, but I am familiar with five-time Crossfit Champion Matt Fraser who has just retired from competition. Before winning the CrossFit Games consecutively from 2016–2020, Matt had a long path having broken two vertebrae before the Junior World Weightlifting Championship in 2009. After experimental back surgery he built himself back up, one day at a time, over 7 years to win his first Crossfit Games.I like Matt’s story (his Joe Rogan episode is a good listen) because it is a perfect testament to the old adage that hard work pays off #HWPO. It really does. Like an athlete, Being a really talented designer takes time. It requires you to do countless unglamorous design iterations and create countless wrong ideas to eventually gain experience and mastery to get to the right ideas. Young designers starting out often fail to understand this. It is unlikely that you will significantly improve as a designer if you limit your activity to your day job. To creatively excel is to learn passionately and to spend the thousands of hours needed to improve, mature, and get better. This may sound terrible, but if you love something and you want to be good at it time does not matter. You have to put in your reps to perfect your craft. Plain and simple.I was listening to an Instagram Live interview with one of my favorite creative studios Young Jerks, and they touched on a really specific dimension of hard work. Someone asked: “How do you get your skill level up to your taste level?” This is such a simple and brilliant question that everyone that wants to be better asks themselves. The only answer is practice. And practice takes time and hard work. I have agonized over typeface selection, final colors, formal decisions, kerning, you name it. Why? Because I could feel that the work could be better. I could sense it and if I pushed further I could find it. This feeling has never left me. Those magical moments that take your idea from its creation to then have that idea live beyond you and be experienced and positively impact others can be a really profound thing. It’s what every great song is about, it’s what great design is about. Hard work does not guarantee moments of brilliance, it just sets the stage for it to be more likely to happen.I hope the above maxims might be helpful to you. They have helped me navigate the ups and downs of my creative and professional work, but what one believes to be true is always a work in progress.

Reading Toni Morrison as a college student — novels like The Bluest Eye and Song of Solomon — changed me. Discovering writers like Mark Twain or James Baldwin revealed something essential to me about our country’s character and our history.Books showed me how to step into someone else’s shoes and gave me a sense of my own identity — both of which would prove vital as a citizen, a community organizer, and president.Today, books that shaped my life — and many others — are being challenged in schools, bookstores, and libraries by people who disagree with certain ideas or perspectives. Often, these “banned books” are written by or feature people of color and members of LGBTQ communities.This is a mistake. Not only is it important for young people to see themselves represented in the pages of books, but it’s also important for all of us to engage with different ideas and points of view.At some level, we are all connected. We share a common humanity. If we listen to each other instead of trying to silence certain voices and shut down debate, we can see each other for who we are and maybe even change some minds — or at least agree to live together. If we don’t, we’ll only grow further apart.There’s also a very particular American tradition enshrined in the first amendment: that freedom begins with our capacity to share and access ideas, even ideas we may disagree with or find deeply offensive.That’s why I’m celebrating Banned Books Week and the freedom to read with people across the country. Because the ability to learn about each other and engage with different ideas doesn’t just open our minds and broaden our perspectives — it brings communities together and strengthens our democracy.What gives me hope is that young people, educators, librarians, and organizers seem to understand this better than most.I’m thankful for leaders like Rebecca, one of our Obama Foundation Scholars, and Iesha who are making sure Chicagoans of all ages have access to powerful literature.I’m grateful for people like Cameron who fought censorship in Texas by organizing a student-led movement that eventually distributed more than 700 challenged or banned books.We also owe a debt of gratitude to the team at the Brooklyn Library, and everyone who is helping make sure that readers across the country have access to great books.This Banned Books Week, I hope you’ll take a moment to appreciate the stories that need to be told. And I hope you’ll join me in reminding anyone who will listen — and even those who won’t — that the free, robust exchange of ideas has always been at the heart of American democracy.'], ['Generation Exposed', 'Emily Willingham', 'Oct 20', 'https://medium.com/@EmilyJaneWillingham/generation-exposed-2bc1a3191954?source=home---------124------------------0----------', 'Adolescence is our longest period of brain development and, as those of us who survived it can attest, can be quite a wild ride.

As far back as the history books go, humans have always expressed themselves creatively, whether for communication, storytelling, or even art. As the tools that we’ve used to express ourselves have evolved and multiplied, so too have the manifestations of our creativity.Today, not only are the tools easy to use, they’re also increasingly powerful. Plus, we now have immediate access to a limitless ocean of others’ creative work through our powerful smartphones and a world washed in high speed internet. This combination of ease-of-use and instant, ubiquitous access to content has unlocked the inner creativity in all of us, unleashing a massive, humanity-sized addressable market of opportunity.But wait, isn’t the Creator Economy dying? According to The Information, as of October 2022, venture funding for Creator Economy startups had fallen for the previous five quarters. The category, recently immortalized (and even more recently betrayed) by venture capitalists, startup founders, and tech journalists, was the promise that creators on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok could now start making a living from their content, en masse. The Creator Economy promised to deliver not only tools to help creators make money, but ultimately, the potential for true economic independence.Pandemic about to take your job away? No problem; the Creator Economy is here to save you from unemployment and fund your daily Instagram habit. Right?Not so much.As it turns out, the constrained opportunity of the Creator Economy hasn’t lived up to its sky-high expectations. As many creators quickly learned, finding 1,000 true fans is something very few people are actually able to do. Most creators can’t break through platforms’ algorithms. Most creators are not marketing experts. Most creators are not making content that is relevant to more than a handful of people. And no, I’m sorry to say, but most creators aren’t going to benefit from their content being “ownable” on the blockchain. This is not a criticism of most creators; it’s a simple acknowledgement that the market for creators’ work follows the same power law dynamic that most other markets face.All of this is completely OK; there is nothing at all wrong with creating for the sake of creativity.In fact, there’s a strong case to be made that the aggregate value of all creator content in the 99% (referenced in the “everyone else” category in the image above) is actually equal to or greater than the value in the head (the “top 10,000 creators” referenced). The 99%, however, is much harder to build for, aggregate, and monetize, which is likely why it was so overlooked in the context of The Creator Economy.And for the few creators who can find 1,000 fans, they can no longer reliably count on their economic support in a market downturn. After all, if you lose your job and your paycheck, which expense will you choose to eliminate first: groceries, or your monthly donation to your favorite YouTuber?In hindsight, the reasons for the failed promise seem somewhat obvious: the Creator Economy was never really meant to be a solution for 99% of the hundreds of millions (or quite possibly billions) of creators that exist today; instead, it was designed to operationalize the financial infrastructure for the top 1% — the creators who have already broken through and found demand for their work. The Creator Economy was never about democratization; it was about elitism.But creativity is universal. And the 99% matter. There’s arguably nothing more democratic than everyone on the planet being able to create and share their work with the world.What if the promise of the “Creator Economy” failed because we collectively (myself included) defined the opportunity for creativity as far too small? What if we were thinking about one small piece of the market for creativity? Surely there is much more to creativity than the tools that enable the top 1% of creators to make money. What if the opportunity for creativity is much bigger than what we’ve all been calling the Creator Economy? I believe it is. I call this opportunity, The Creativity Supply Chain.You can think of it like this:The Creativity Supply Chain is the global market for creativity in today’s modern economy. It is made up of the supply, incentives, and demand that drive how and why people create. And it rests on the technology-enabled superpowers which turbocharge all of the above, generating massive market value in the process.I have always believed that people are inherently creative. I was raised by parents who encouraged me to pursue my many — and scattered — creative interests. I grew up playing the drums, learning to code in high school, studying Computer Science in college, and dabbling with music, photography, painting, and writing all along the way. As a career, my interest in creativity led me to build websites for artists at Atlantic Records and eventually build products which enabled hundreds of millions of people to take and edit photos at Aviary and Adobe. The belief that people are inherently creative was also one of the factors that led my former co-founder Nir Zicherman and me to build Anchor, a platform which democratizes podcast creation, and was acquired by Spotify in 2019.But in 2022, I believe it should be obvious to nearly everyone that we are all creative. We write, take photos, edit videos, design presentations. We all create content using tools like our phone’s camera, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, BeReal, Twitter, and YouTube. We make podcasts, webinars, short films, and crafts. We share the things we create with family, friends, our co-workers, and strangers all over the world. We spread knowledge with colleagues, partners, and prospective employers using tools like Google Docs, Coda, Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Loom, and Descript, while sharing ideas, photos, memes from Giphy, and weekend plans with our friends and family using Pinterest, Google Photos, and WhatsApp. We’re all being creative all the time. We all create constantly, every single day.Our incentives to be creative are varied. We create to communicate. We create for money. We create to express ourselves artistically. We create because our work requires us to do so. We create for attention; we like the feeling we get when the view count on our video starts shooting up. Sometimes we create simply to make our friends laugh.Technology has helped streamline these incentives. Notifications buzz our phones and inboxes to let us know when others interact with our content, giving us micro doses of joy and much-needed confidence. Our teammates quickly provide feedback on work in real time using a multitude of multi-player enabled creative tools. For those of us looking to monetize our work, we can easily sell our audience’s attention to the highest bidder on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok, for we are today’s version of yesterday’s magazines, television stations, and billboards. With enough distribution, a few of us are even able to get our audience to pay us directly for our work through platforms like Patreon, Substack, OnlyFans, OpenSea, Fanfic, Pietra, and more.Regardless of our own unique incentives, we all create because there is one universal incentive which all creators share in 2022: there is overwhelming demand for creativity.You are a perfect example of this demand. Think about it: how do you spend your time? You watch videos on YouTube, look at stories and photos and Reels on Instagram, get sucked into TikTok for hours at a time, interact with designs by your colleagues on Figma, laugh at memes your friends send you on Telegram, binge watch shows on Netflix, look at friends’ baby photos on Facebook, read thoughtful essays on Substack, listen to podcasts on Spotify, scroll through beautiful websites on Chrome, read books on Kindle, scan your local news, get dinner recipes on Pinterest… the list goes on and on and on. You are the ultimate destination for a long list of content that once began as a spark of creativity in the mind of another person somewhere else in the world. This essay, which you are reading right now, and the hand drawn graphics referenced throughout are all expressions of my creativity.By this time next year, you will probably be consuming even more creativity as more products and services launch and your devices become more powerful. And while your demand for creativity continues to grow, so too does that demand for nearly everyone else on this planet; especially people who are just coming online for the first time in their lives, such as in emerging nations which are just gaining access to high speed internet.For every region which is nearing saturation of creativity supply and demand, there is another one just getting started on the bottom of the S-curve. We are not at the end of something; we’re at the beginning of global creative ubiquity.All of the above is happening in greater volume and velocity than ever before through what I like to think of as creative superpowers. Technology has made us all more creative through better tools. It has given us the ability to more easily achieve our creative goals (whether they be financial, social, or otherwise). And it has made it possible for us to find an audience for our work, no matter where in the world we are, physically. As we consume, we become more inspired to create ourselves, fueling a virtuous cycle of creativity that spins faster and faster as technology improves.The history of computing has proven time and time again that all forms of creativity eventually become democratized by technology. The costs of creating content are always being reduced by technology, and the abilities of people to create compelling content through technology are always increasing.This trend began long ago (Printing press? Invention of the pencil? Rock, blood, and berry juice used to scribble on walls of caves?), but perhaps became most apparent on the internet through text and publishing of the written word. It was previously challenging for non-journalists to publish written text. But eventually, Blogger, Wordpress, and ultimately Medium made it vastly easier through easy-to-use tools and one-tap publishing capabilities. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter took it a step further by simplifying the format and enabling distribution of text to people within our social networks. Now nearly everyone writes and publishes some form of content.The same happened for photos. It was previously extremely challenging for anyone other than professional photographers to take, edit, and share photographs at scale. Then, Instagram made it possible for anyone to take and share beautiful photos with the tap of a button. Now, everyone takes and shares photos.YouTube and TikTok did the same for videos. Anchor did the same for audio and podcasts. And the same can be said about a number of other categories. No-code website development products, platforms that enable the easy creation of video games, and even software that democratizes the creation of businesses/products are a few examples of the trend playing out in other categories. Many others will undoubtedly follow.Technology-enabled creative tools have democratized creation to the point where any of us can create with the right tools, skills, and investment of time. But artificial intelligence (AI) is taking things many steps further. AI has recently reached a new tipping point, enabling any of us to achieve incredible feats of creativity by typing a few words into a text box. Cutting edge AI models such as Stable Diffusion, OpenAI’s DALL-E, and Midjourney make it possible to create visual images of limitless possibilities, making it possible for any of us to create things we previously could only imagine within seconds.And while today’s mainstream AI models are focused mostly on imaging, it’s only a matter of time before audio, music, video, text, and countless other creative mediums are soon disrupted by AI. Even writing code itself is in the process of being disrupted by AI.This past weekend, Nathan Baschez and the Every team introduced a product called Lex that helps writers by using AI to provide automatically-generated suggestions for what to say next. Within hours, Lex had thousands of people signed up to its waiting list. It’s not hard to imagine a world in which the cost of creativity plummets as a result of the rise of AI-enabled generative media. Ten years from now, will major movie studios be investing hundreds of millions in blockbuster films? Or will a state of the art AI model do all the work instead for orders of magnitude less?As of 2022, a 83% of the world’s population has access to a smartphone. That means that the vast majority of us on this planet are carrying around pocket-sized supercomputers virtually everywhere we go. And here in the US, many of us now have access to 5G internet at all times. With 5G, we’re able to download or stream massive amounts of creative media to our devices virtually instantaneously. Just think about everything you are now able to do from your mobile device. You’re able to watch full length movies with the tap of a button, access the world’s complete catalog of music, and even edit 4K video collaboratively, with your teammates, in the cloud. Ubiquitous, ultra fast internet makes the Creativity Supply Chain hum.And there are major tailwinds behind this superpower. 5G market penetration is only at 13% globally and it is expected to reach 64% by 2030. As more people gain access to 5G in the coming years, it’s only going to get easier to instantly perform creative tasks and consume creative media. And 6G, which will be even more powerful than 5G and make creative mediums like AR and VR more accessible, is expected to begin rolling out in the year 2030.One of the biggest breakthroughs for creativity over the past few decades has been the rise of media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, Twitter, Outschool, MasterClass, LinkedIn, and countless others across a variety of categories. While media platforms have traditionally relied on curated friend and interest graphs to match supply-side media with demand, platforms have recently learned that leveraging machine learning can drive far greater efficiency in distribution. As a result, media platforms across nearly every category — including social networks — are abandoning curation in exchange for recommendation media, which I recently wrote about extensively in a recent essay. Further advancements in machine learning and recommendation media will have massive implications on both the supply and demand sides of creativity.For creators, finding an audience for your creativity will happen automatically upon platform distribution. We’ll upload our content, and the platform’s ML algorithms will find the perfect audience at the perfect time for our work. And on the demand side, we will instantly and easily access the exact content we want to consume with far less friction. The supply and demand flywheel of creativity will spin far faster as a result of machine learning.Given how quickly all sides of creativity are becoming propelled by technology, it’s clear that each and every one of us will make up the total addressable market of the Creativity Supply Chain. But make no mistake; the Creativity Supply Chain isn’t some theoretical concept from the future; it’s happening right now.As of this writing, public companies with core businesses in the Creativity Supply Chain — such as Spotify, Shopify, Squarespace, Adobe, and Snap — represent more than $370B of market capitalization. And companies with big stakes in the Creativity Supply Chain — like Meta, Apple, Alphabet, and Netflix — represent more than $7T of market capitalization.In private markets, look no further than the latest major technology acquisition — Adobe’s $20 billion acquisition of Figma, the largest ever acquisition of a venture-backed company — for proof that there is massive demand for companies contributing to the Creativity Supply Chain.And Canva, a company that makes it easy for anyone to create beautiful images and graphics for both professional and personal use cases recently topped 100M monthly active users and is reported to be generating more than $1B in annual revenue.The demand for Creativity Supply Chain businesses will only increase. As we all spend more of our time creating and consuming, and more of our personal and professional lives become transformed by technology, creativity will be even more entrenched in nearly everything we do on a daily basis.You can’t contain or limit the potential of creativity to specific incentives, such as the monetization of one’s top 1,000 fans. Yes, there will always be financial markets built around monetizing the work of top creators. But the reasons why people create are far more universal and fundamental to our common humanity, and these reasons result in a tremendous amount of aggregate value. And this is why the opportunity for creativity will continue to grow and flourish in lock step with technology. I like to imagine that today’s creative tools are the ones Steve Jobs was dreaming of when he first called computing a bicycle for the mind.Everyone is creative. Technology increasingly fuels our collective ability to create, the incentives that motivate us to create, and our insatiable demand for the things others create. And through recent technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high speed internet access, the market for creativity is destined to reach new heights in the coming years and decades.What do you think? Is creativity becoming the central driving force behind our modern Internet economy? And what’s next for the technology that powers the Creativity Supply Chain?

He would live 13 more years before dying at age 26 of pneumonia.The history of type 1 diabetes since that time has been a battle on two fronts. First, the search for a cause of and cure for the disease. Second, the effort to make the administration of insulin safer, more reliable, and easier.The past two decades have seen a technological revolution in Type 1 diabetes care, with continuous glucose monitors decreasing the need for painful finger sticks, and insulin pumps allowing for more precise titration of doses.The dream, of course, has been to combine those two technologies — continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps — to create so-called “closed loop” systems — basically an artificial pancreas — that would obviate the need for any intervention on the part of the patient save the occasional refilling of an insulin reservoir.We aren’t there yet — but we are closer than ever.Closed-loop systems for insulin delivery, like the Tandem Control IQ system, are a marvel of technology, but they are not exactly hands free. Users need to dial in settings for their insulin usage, count carbohydrates at meals, and inform the system that they are about to eat those meals to allow the algorithm to administer an appropriate insulin dose.The perceived complexity of these systems may be responsible for why there are substantial disparities in the prescription of closed-loop systems. Kids of lower socioeconomic status are dramatically less likely to receive these advanced technologies. Providers may feel patients with lower health literacy or social supports are not “ideal” for these technologies, even though they lead to demonstrably better outcomes.That means that easier might be better. And a “bionic pancreas” — as reported in this article from the New England Journal this week — is exactly that.Broadly, it’s another closed-loop system. The bionic pancreas integrates with a continuous glucose monitor and administers insulin when needed. But the algorithm appears to be a bit smarter than what we have in existing devices. For example, the patient does not need to provide any information about their usual insulin doses — just their body weight. They don’t need to count carbohydrates at meals — just to inform the device when they are eating, and whether the meal is the usual amount they eat, more, or less. The algorithm learns and adapts as it is used. Easy.And, in this randomized trial, easy does it.219 participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the bionic pancreas or usual diabetes care, though it was required that control participants used a continuous glucose monitor.Participants were as young as 6 years old up to 79 years old, majority white, and had a relatively high household income. The mean A1C was around 7.8% at baseline.By the end of the study, the A1C was significantly improved in the bionic pancreas group, with a mean of 7.3% vs 7.7% in the usual care group.This effect was most pronounced in those with higher A1Cs at baseline, as you can see here.People randomized to the bionic pancreas also spent more time in the target glucose range of 70–180 mg/dL.All in all — the technology that makes it easy to manage your blood sugar, well, made it easy to manage your blood sugar.But new technology is never without its hiccups. You can see that those randomized to the bionic pancreas had a markedly higher rate of adverse events 244 events in 126 people compared to 10 events in 8 people in the usual care group.This is actually a little misleading though — the vast majority of these events were hyperglycemic episodes due to infusion set failures — which were only reportable in the bionic pancreas group. In other words, the patients in the control group who had an infusion set failure (assuming they were using an insulin pump at all) would have just called their regular doctor to get things sorted and not reported it to the study team.Nevertheless, these adverse events — not serious, but common — highlight the fact that good software is not the only key to solving the closed-loop problem. We need good hardware too — hardware that can withstand the very active lives children with Type 1 diabetes deserve to live.In short, the dream of a functional cure to type 1 diabetes — a true artificial pancreas, is closer than ever, but it’s still just a dream. With iterative advancements like this though, the reality may be here before you know it.A version of this commentary first appeared on Medscape.com.'], ['The No-Excuses Guide to Physical Activity', 'Robert Roy Britt', 'Sep 19', 'https://robertroybritt.medium.com/the-no-excuses-guide-to-physical-activity-36e40cb5d8f8?source=home---------257------------------0----------', 'W\\nhen I write about the health benefits of physical activity, readers often comment about the impediments of busy lives, old age, chronic pain or other limitations.

Each bringing their own set of tools and knowledge, applying different techniques and choosing different compromises.Observing a method evolve over time is a good way of realizing how wide the performance spectrum can be, even for simple routines. That’s especially the case when dealing with high level languages — with lots of moving parts between source and compiled code, opportunities to cut execution time are everywhere, sometimes they are obvious, sometimes not so much.We are going to take a simple checksum method and hand it to six different developers, named Junior, Pro, Senior, Hacker, Expert and Genius. They’ll exhaust their abilities trying to optimize it and we, hopefully, will learn something from each one of them.Here are the constraints:Without further ado, here’s what I call the Junior checksum:The method is pretty straightforward, accumulating 4 column sums and reducing them to a single uint using the LSB from each accumulator. Given the requirements, this is what I would expect an educated junior developer to deliver.So now our little checksum gets handed to Pro. Pro has been around a bit and learned a few tricks, but still can’t be called a senior.The first thing Pro does is to benchmark Junior’s code to establish a baseline.The benchmark uses a 1MB buffer filled with random data.Here are the results:Are these numbers good or bad? 1.8ms for 1Mb of data seems pretty fast but the task is clear: make it even faster. After scratching their head for a while, Pro decides to do loop unrolling.Loop unrolling is a technique that trades code size for performance. The idea is to do more work per loop iteration. So instead of:one would write:The main reasoning behind it is that in every iteration, there will be a comparison ( x < 100 ), an addition ( x++ ), and a jump. By repeating the statements, the compiled code results in fewer operations, since now the jump and the comparison happen only once in every 5 work() calls.Pro’s version of the checksum:While possible, this version operates on 16 bytes per iteration. After that it does a couple of 4-byte loops and finally adds the last 3, 2 or 1 remaining bytes. These are way more lines of code, but was it worth it?The comparison benchmark screams yes. It’s 5 times faster than Junior’s.We hand the task now to Senior, with the same simple mandate: make it faster.Senior has been around for quite a while, actually for so long that when they first started programming, C# was a joke. Senior wrote a lot of code in C, knows pointers and understands assembly code.Notice some of the Gists only display the most relevant loop in the solution. At the end of this article there’s a link to a Github repository you can fork and play.The updated benchmark, a 1.6x improvement over Pro’s and 7.8x over Junior’s:The code looks a lot like Pro’s, so let’s break down the changes and understand what’s going on.The first edit is adding the unsafe keyword to the signature. This allows us, for instance, to use pointers inside the method. In C# world, it’s a statement the developer makes that translates to “I know what I’m doing, compiler, be cool.”The most common way to use a pointer in C# is inside a fixed scope. In C#’s documentation’s own words:Basically, it ensures the pointer we get remains valid and the CLR won’t move the underlying data around. This kind of concern only happens here because we are operating in a managed memory environment. The CLR adds an abstraction layer between what we think of as variables and the actual memory address at which are located. (Well, to be fair, the OS also adds an abstraction layer, offering processes virtual memory, but that’s out of scope for us here). Every abstraction invariably introduces overhead. That’s the price developers pay for the convenience of a garbage collector. To use pointers in C# is to temporarily bypass that abstraction.From here on the code looks almost exactly the same, but instead of indexing an array, it indexes the pointer:At the end of the day, C# code will be translated to machine code for execution. When you reach this level of detail, every instruction removed from the execution path counts. Take these two methods for instance:The version using unsigned integers has one instruction less. Because in the first method we are using int, the compiler adds a movsxd before every memory access (movzx).movsxd is Move with Sign-ExtensionBasically, it’s converting from a signed integer to an unsigned one in order to index the pointer. You may think that one extra instruction does no harm, but if that happens to be in a tight loop, 6 instructions versus 7 can translate to a 15% difference in performance.It’s also worth mentioning that in our case, although displaying X86 ASM code, what actually happens is that compiler outputs IL code which will then be compiled to machine code by the JIT compiler depending on the platform. Statements made here might not be valid for the ARM instruction set, for example.Besides that, there’s no guarantee the JIT will always output the same ASM instructions. The JIT is an engineering feat, full of heuristics and in constant evolution. Code we write today might compile to a different set of instructions tomorrow because the JIT got updated with new performance tricks. That’s the bright side of working on top of a framework with a just-in-time compiler — our code might run faster without us actually shipping updates. On the downside, it makes performance less predictable.OK, but what really changed between Pro’s and Senior’s versions? Let’s look at a section of the decompiled ASM from both:It’s easy to notice a pattern, even without knowing exactly what each ASM instruction is doing:versus:Let’s break the first lines down:What is this jump doing here?If check what’s at label G_M000_IG17, we find:Alright — it seems it’s a range check failure. Now it becomes clear: the extra instructions are the ones responsible for throwing an exception if the code tries to access an out-of-bounds position of an array. This is what makes the above snippet throw an exception instead of reading undefined data at arr[2]:What happens if bounds are not checked, and invalid addresses are accessed? All sorts of nasty things, SEGFAUTS and alike included. Not pretty. This is C# putting training wheels on your bicycle.Senior’s code, by using the unsafe keyword and pointers, avoids these bound checks in the tight loop. As a result, most of the read/write pattern end up using 3 instructions instead of 6.Some would argue that the most important aspect is actually removing all those jumps, since a jump means branching, and branching means a CPU has to do speculative execution and try to predict which path the branch will take. I get it, but for this exercise, let’s just consider fewer instructions equals less work for the sake of simplicity.Senior’s solution is great. It takes outside-the-box thinking to move beyond that. We hand it over to Hacker. The task is still the same: make it faster.We get this:A 2x improvement over Senior’s with what may look like garbage to the untrained eye. Some of you readers, however, might have figured out the trick already. Did you? Leave a comment and tell me :)In the context of our challenge here, the definition of a hacker is:Often when you read source code from really performance-sensitive projects, like the Linux kernel for instance, you come across sections that look like sorcery spells written in ASCII characters. A great exercise is to go understand those bits and break down the techniques used so they become building blocks you can use to compose clever solutions to problems you yourself might be facing further down the road.The trick here is the repurpose of a long as a 4-wide short vector. Let’s break the relevant section down:So this first little trick is reading 8 bytes into a ulong . Assuming we are in a x64 machine, this is a single memory fetch. Then this is done 3 times more:At this point we effectively read 4 ulong, or 32 bytes of data, at the cost of 4 instructions versus the 32 needed to read byte by byte.The next trick is applying a mask to the first long. If we annotate the bytes at l1, on a Little-endian system, it looks like:And applying that mask we getNow what happens if we were to look at this masked long two bytes at a time?It’s B0, B2, B4 and B4 widened from a single byte word to a 2-wide word. We transformed each byte into a short.This does the same for the odd bytes, shifting one byte to get them in the right position. Doing that for all the 4 ulongwe read, we now have:What happens if we sum M1 to M3, M5 and M7? Assuming the individualLet’s call the short view of those S1, S2, S3 and S4:Recalling the previous version, the accumulators were:It’s clear that we can achieve the same accumulation using these bit manipulations.But what if, instead, we keep summing these longs before merging the shorts into sum0, sum1 etc.?We are now hacking a ulong, repurposing it as a 4-wide shortvector. But there’s a catch: we can’t let the sum of any individual element overflow the max value of an unsigned short 0xFFFF.We are adding 4 bytes to each short at each iteration, so we can do that safely 64 times before we reach 0xFF.Past that point, any of the shorts could overflow and our hacked vector, corrupted. So, once we do 64 iterations, we extract each of the vector's value and add it to the original sums, resetting the vectors. This is exactly what this section is doing:Here’s what the ASM code looks like for the tight loop:And here is an expanded and annotated version with intermediate variables that might be easier to follow:One the main characteristics I use to describe an expert is an ability to analyze problems from their fundamentals. You see, all our fellow developers bulldozed through the task, dumping all their knowledge on top of their predecessors. None of them questioned the reasoning — they just improved upon it using the tools they had.Our Expert looks back to the first version of the method:The clue here is the fact this is a big-endian checksum. This could be figured out by understanding the code itself, but this comment line has been there all along, stating the fundamental point of this method.As a recap, Endianness refers to the order in which bytes appear in a word. For numbers, it refers to the first byte being MSB or LSB.The majority of systems today are Little-endian, but what would happen if we were actually in a Big-Endian system? The method’s core loop could be as simple as:This is exactly a 32-bit sum of the input array. But because we are in Little-endian, when reading 4 bytes their order is reversed compared with what it should be for the simple sum to work. All that is needed is to read an int, reverse their bytes, and sum.Finally, here’s Expert’s version:Almost twice as fast as Hacker’s, with the added benefit of readable code.\\nThis is the line that addresses the fundamental issue with all the other solutions:It reverses the byte ordering for each of the 4 bytes read. This translates to a single ASM instructionHere’s the definition of MOVBE: Move Data After Swapping Bytes. It reads and swap bytes in one shot. Another instruction for this purpose would be BSWAP, which operates in place in a register. So now Expert showed us we can operate across endianness without adding extra instructions.SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple Data, and I know a lot of you readers were expecting to see a SIMD solution. The key point is that SIMD instructions allow us to operate on more bytes at a time. Our checksum seems like a perfect candidate for such vectorization.This is a rough timeline of availability of SIMD extensions on Intel CPUs. We are going to focus on AVX and AVX2, which are respectively 128 and 256 bits wide. Targeting AVX and AVX2 means targeting any CPU made from 2011 onwards.Dotnet introduced Hardware Intrinsics back in dotnet core 3. You can read more about it here: Hardware Intrinsics in .NET Core — .NET Blog (microsoft.com). Currently it supports up to AVX2. AVX512 should eventually be available as well.Let’s look at the AVX solution first:The star function here is Avx.Shuffle, which compiles to vpshufb. This instruction allows us to reorder and mask bytes in a single shot by providing a mask argument. We crafted a mask that will swap endianness for each 4-byte block.It then reinterprets the vector as a vector of unsigned intand adds it to an accumulator vector. In ASM, this looks like:Now using only 3 instructions, we were able to process 16 bytes. How fast was it?Not bad! Another 2x improvement. We are now, thanks to Expert, approximately 57 times faster than Junior.The next step is to move from 128-wide vectors to 256-wide vectors. The implementation is pretty similar but there are some gotchas we need to pay attention to. For instance, for most operations, a Vector256 is actually considered to be two lanes of 128-wide ones. That’s out of scope here — let’s see if we can finally get to the 100x faster we were hoping to:Around 85 times faster than Junior. Almost there!It’s important to notice that we went from processing 563MB/s to 48GB/s. At these rates, the bottleneck becomes memory access and not the CPU.Let’s pause and think for a bit. The system I’m using has DDR4 memory, which according to Wikipedia shouldn’t be able to do better than 25GBs. So how is it possible for our benchmark to run at 48GB/s?The only reason we are observing these rates is because our test data fits entirely into the CPU’s L3 cache, which in the case of the Intel i7 10875H I’m using here has 16MB. The L3 cache sits much closer to CPU cores and can peak at 200GB/s, but that will vary a lot depending on the CPU. If our data were to fit into L2 or even L1 we would see even higher numbers.Running the same benchmark with a 100MB array should expose us to RAM bottlenecking, and indeed:At 17GB/s, it actually meets closely the specs of the particular memory modules I have. If we were to read the file from storage, we would be bound by disk speeds, not RAM, not L3 cache and definitely not the CPU.That being said, as a software engineer, it’s important to understand that performance numbers derive from various factors in a system, and code is important but it’s only one of the components. Understanding the low-level components of your target system may help you plan how to arrange and move memory more efficiently.I initially stated this is something we would not explore. The reason should be obvious now. Besides the RAM bottleneck, L3 cache is shared among all cores in a typical CPU, so it is kind of pointless.Constraints considered — I know there’s r room to squeeze more from the solutions presented here in this article.Here’s a repo you can clone and submit a pull request with your own version:I’ll update this article with the best ones.

Things spiralled from there.All of which is to say that River didn’t learn algebra last year.I mean it: zero algebra was learned. He wasn’t even present in my classroom for most of three marking periods.

I’d think that if there really were state tests with college scholarships and graduation requirements on the line (not to mention the precious state data that NYSED reports to the federal DOE), and if you really could pass those state tests by checking all Cs, then there would have been an uproar.I’d be thinking that someone would have reported on this already.

But none of them responded other than “I’ll forward this to so-and-so.” Except for Tyler Cowen, who said, “Maybe a Medium piece?”So here’s the Medium piece.What are the New York State Regents Exams?In New York, these exams are commonly called simply the Regents, as in, Did you study for the physics Regents last night?, and, That English Regents was easier than your mom.The Regents are important. In math, for example, NYSED offers three Regents exams: Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. You must pass at least one to graduate from a public high school.Furthermore, in most schools, the Regents exam counts as a significant percentage of your final grade in a particular course. Surveys of science teachers on SUNY Oneonta’s listservs (people still use listservs!) report a common range of 10–15% of a student’s final average being comprised of his Regents score. I don’t know of a similar statewide survey for math teachers, but in my district and the ones I’m familiar with, math Regents exam scores also account for about 10–15% of a final grade.The Regents themselves — NYSED’s ruling council — and their appointed commissioner have put out an official statement recommending against this policy.But whom are they kidding? If an exam doesn’t count for a grade, will a student study for it? Let me give you the official answer based on my decades of teaching: hell no. Especially not in June, when the pools are open and the blue raspberry Slushees are flowing and the summer jobs and camps are starting. Especially not after school has finished.Oh, did I not mention that?New York administers these exams a week or two after “regular” school is done. New York public high schools have this odd “last day of school” every year on a Friday, and then two days later, everyone just shows up again on Monday for Regents review classes. This is why the New York school year doesn’t effectively end until June 25th or so. This is dumb. There is a pattern here.So to provide motivation, teachers end up making the Regents exam count for a large portion of a course’s final grade. If students were to fail Regents exams left and right, parents and school boards and superintendents and budget officers and many of the students themselves would be upset.They’d be upset because the Regents exams matter.They matter for scholarships and “free” college programs and what courses you can take at SUNY universities and university honors programs and — and do not underestimate how highly parents and students value this — which cords a high school graduate wears around her neck at graduation.The state exam scores also matter to school districts because a school with terrible test scores will be under NYSED’s spotlight — they call it a “focus” school — and come in for mountains of additional paperwork, meetings, and ultimately a humiliating loss of local control. NYSED also prides itself on “data-driven” decisions about what research to pursue, what grants to award, and what programs to fix or update or terminate. Care to guess what data is in the driver’s seat in that data-driven car? You guessed it, test scores. Picture Toonces the Driving Cat, except Toonces is named Test Scores.The bottom line is that because the Regents exams are important, NYSED is very careful to produce high quality tests that challenge the students and accurately measure and report student progress.Ha, just kidding. That cat is driving you right off a cliff.The NYS Regents Algebra ExamsHere is the NYSED Regents Examination in Algebra One page for those who want to follow along at home. I’ll be pasting in screenshots as we go.Let’s look at tests from the previous few years first. Ah, there they are, the warning signs.This is the score conversion chart from the June 2018 Algebra One Regents exam. The minimum passing grade is a scaled score of 65. What you can see from this chart is that in order to get a scaled score of 65, a student needs a raw score of 26.Out of 86.Well. That’s a warning sign, all right. 30% required to pass the big year-end final? Seems way too easy. I’ll mention now that it’s the same for the Geometry and Algebra 2 tests over the past several years, only 30% is needed to pass.Still. Maybe the test is difficult. I can imagine a test where 30% merits a pass. It’s probably not a great test, but I can imagine it. Let’s look at this test and see if passing with 30% is reasonable.So there are 24 multiple choice questions worth 2 points on your raw score each. A total possible of 48 points. And then the constructed response section.13 more questions, 8 worth 2 points, 4 worth 4 points, and one worth 6 points. Total of 38 points. Together with the first section, that’s 48+38 = 86 points possible in your raw score.So far so good. Let’s look at the problems.Oh.Uh-oh.Yeah. This is not a hard test.NYSED should be ashamed of requiring algebra students to score only 30% to pass a test this easy. It’s stuffed with know-the-definition, yes-or-no questions and reading comprehension questions without any algebra required. Other questions require nothing more than copying a graph from a calculator, and yes, graphing calculators are not just allowed, but required (check the bolded and boxed text on page 1).But hold on, Ed, you’re saying. You still can’t pass this with all Cs!True. This is the 2018 test. If you answered all Cs on this and left the constructed response section blank, you’d score 14 points, a dozen short of passing. That’s embarrassing enough, honestly, and NYSED should be ashamed at how easy those other 14 points are to achieve (partly because they’re awfully close to repeating the same questions every year, as they do on the Earth Science test, and no I am not making that up about the Earth Science test — but that’s another essay), but the truth remains that guessing all Cs wouldn’t let you pass the 2018 test. Not quite.I suppose that explains why I was never outraged enough back in the good old days to write this piece. Outraged, yes, but it takes a special kind of outrage to make me put down the watermelon and write a Medium essay.Then 2022 came along and asked 2018 to hold its beer.Off the CliffIf the circa 2010s grading scales were the warning signs, then this letter was the orange and white striped barricade across the road.This letter is saying that, at least for 2022 and 2023, students only need a 50% scaled score to pass the Regents exam instead of a 65% scaled score. Don’t be fooled by the “special appeal” language. This is not an appeal in any meaningful sense of the word. Every appeal is approved. Every single kid with a 50% scaled score will be passed; the principals and teachers were dancing in the hallways when this letter came out. “Our passing rates will be so high!”Sigh.So let’s look at the raw-to-scaled conversion chart for 2022.Aside from trying to distract us with shiny colored spreadsheet cells, NYSED hasn’t changed anything from 2018. Only now, instead of a 65% scaled score, you need a 50%. That is, instead of a raw score of 26/86 or 30.3%, you need 17/86, or 19.8%, to pass this test. This is how I knew to tell River what to do.How hard are those 17 points to get?A cat driving a car could get those 17 points. C for cat. C is choice 3 in the scoring key column here.Answer all Cs, you get 9 right. Each one is worth two points. That’s 18 points, enough to pass.More than enough to pass, in fact.I really didn’t know what to say when I first saw this. I suppose I was thinking like Chuck Heston. “They finally, really did it.” This is jaw-dropping malfeasance. I wouldn’t believe that anyone who claims to care about kids could let this happen — not until I saw it happen.Shame on NYSED and the Regents.The statistically astute reader (and let’s be honest, that’s all of you who are still reading) will object that River got a little lucky. There were 9 “C” answers but with four choices in 24 questions you really should only expect to get 6 “C” answers.To which I say: let me tell you what happened with River. You may have guessed that I’m fond of River. Kid has the best mullet since Joe Dirt. He lives in the trailer park with his dad and his brother in a single-wide, and together they coordinate our annual ice-fishing tournament, which is a big deal around here. But darned if I wasn’t really upset with him after this year’s Regents exam.That’s because River didn’t quite answer all Cs. No. He took it upon himself to deviate from my carefully devised strategy on two problems, for reasons that involved NOTHING GOOD, RIVER, SERIOUSLY WTH. Anyway, of course, both of the two problems where River answered B were actually C.GAHHHHHHHHH!Then how did River still pass, missing those two?Because of the constructed response problems. This juicy 4-pointer is a great example.That is not an algebra problem. It is a four-point gift from the Regents wrapped in graph paper.And by gift, I mean a pedagogical embarrassment that should leave NYSED and the Regents’ credibility crashed and burning at the bottom of the cliff they’ve chosen to drive off.Where do we go from here?This problem has a clear solution: make the algebra exam an exam that actually tests a student’s ability to do algebra.Unfortunately, this solution is difficult to implement. Implementation is difficult because of all the reasons that drove NYSED off the cliffs of insanity in the first place. Look at the incentives. NYSED and local school districts have large financial incentives to graduate as many students as possible. These incentives were put in place by both federal and state legislators who meant well and were trying to encourage good public school performance (good performance == graduation, of course, in their eyes). Teachers and principals have large quality-of-life incentives to pass students. Failing students brings scrutiny, parent and student complaints, superintendent pressure, guidance counselor inquisitions, paperwork, and meeting after meeting. It’s much easier to pass everyone.But what good is a school system where students pass while learning nothing? What good is a test that says a student knows algebra when all he really knows how to do is guess all Cs?The way forward is to reverse the incentives. NYSED ought to be shamed. It ought to be mocked for failing in its duty to provide an education. NYSED ought to be made to pay a price for its failure.I don’t think that reversing the financial incentives is realistically possible in the short or medium term. It would be great if River could sue NYSED for passing him when he knows no algebra, even better if he could spearhead a class-action suit that brought together an army of fellow kids who have been wronged by the system. They deserve tobacco settlement-type money, Epic vs. Apple-type money. But that’s not going to happen.Fortunately, there are other incentives. Prestige is one. Never underestimate the importance of prestige to academics! And wouldn’t NYSED suffer a huge loss in prestige if people found out that it was letting students pass its tests by guessing all Cs?I have to hope that it would.'], ['All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people', 'Marianne Bellotti', 'Aug 5, 2019', 'https://bellmar.medium.com/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f?source=home---------34------------------0----------', 'As I focus on becoming a better manager of engineers, I have been reflecting more and more on the advice that produced a 10X boost in my abilities at that same stage.

As critical as setting boundaries may be, it’s what happens after we set them that determines their usefulness.Maintaining personal boundaries is a life-long process. There are two ways we can approach this process. These two ways are best exemplified by two diverging ways sacred buildings were constructed in the east vs the west. It all boils down to a philosophy of time.Japan is home to some of the most well preserved temples in the world. Where brick and stone ruins litter much of Europe, these wooden buildings endure. Some are more than 1000 years old. Why? Whereas European buildings were often built to resist the forces of nature, Japanese temples were built to embrace them.Many of these wooden Japanese temples and shrines use no nails. This makes it possible to disassemble and reassemble the building. It also makes it a lot easier to replace parts as they inevitably succumb to the seasons. When a piece starts to warp, crack, or rot, they can simply replace it with relative ease.This forward-looking philosophy was also embodied by the resident monks who plant the trees used for the repairs. They plant trees they know will be harvested in future seasons they won’t live to see.Life, like nature, is continually shifting through seasons. Each season brings with it different conditions. As conditions change, so do we, so do our needs. Parts of us are always growing, rotting, blooming, and sometimes in dire need of replacement.Our boundaries are often created in response to specific external conditions. Maybe it was because a person or a situation is causing us a lot of distress. It worked. The problem is, time moved on. Some boundaries can persist long after our circumstances have changed. This is how the boundaries we have often differ from the ones we need.Boundaries that served to protect us in one season of our life, can limit, blind, or even damage us in another. For example, the personal boundaries that protected you from a toxic boss, now cost you tremendous growth opportunities with your new nurturing boss. Or, necessary boundaries set with your last relationship now jeopardize your ability to connect with a new partner.It’s important to keep in mind that it’s not only our seasons that are ever changing, so are everyone else’s. The needs of everyone we know — even those we are most intimately familiar with — are not static. Where boundaries were unnecessary at one point in a familiar relationship, they may become necessary later on.For example, new therapists have a tendency to use their partners as guinea pigs, trying out tools they just learned to “help” their unwilling partner. Or your work friend becomes your boss, and starts leaning on your freindship to guilt you into doing more work.Conditions are always changing, and so must our boundaries. Outdated boundaries can quickly become barriers, trapping us in a past that prevents us from fully engaging with the present.Personal boundaries are ideas about what is and is not acceptable to us. These opinions are formed based on how we judge personal experiences: This felt good. This did not. It is a judgment formed at a moment in time.Each of our boundaries are artifacts of our experiences. Artifact by artifact, we start to build the outline of our comfort zone. This is where we go to avoid pain. This is where we feel safe. The problem is that there is no growth without making ourselves vulnerable, without lowering barriers we’ve spent much of our life erecting to protect ourselves.Personal growth happens almost exclusively outside of our comfort zone, where we are likely to experience pain. The process of persevering despite this pain is what develops our skill, bravery, confidence, our character. It shows us what we’re capable of, replacing fear with a sense of great possibility.Persistence in the face of struggle is how we grow. On the other had, experiencing persistant pain in our lives often indicates the lack of boundaries, which tends to stunt our growth. How do we reconcile the two?The trick is understanding which boundaries are relevant.I believe that boundaries are a set of conditions that we put in place to allow us show up for others and ourselves. We limit access to some, to be more present with our family. We don’t talk about a topic with a loved family member, because that topic drives us apart. If the circumstances that require our boundaries are present, then chances are our boundaries are relevant.Boundaries that don’t actively help us show up are barriers. They may have kept you safe in the past, but now are trapping you there. They’ve now likely become barriers separating you from being the version of yourself you want to be. Common examples include: being distrustful, being quiet, being distant, being unemotional, being agreeable, being safe, avoiding opportunities.Like with the temple, we need to continually remove the rotting pieces that no longer support us, and replace them with ones that do. In order to do that, we need rituals.Healthy boundaries are alive. Like all living things, they need to be maintained. I tend to my boundaries through rituals. Simply put, these rituals are regular checkins to examine sources of discomfort in my life.My rituals are simple. I schedule time each week and month to look for sources of discomfort in my life. I do this by reviewing my calendar and journal, asking myself some questions, and then journaling about what comes up. Let’s break that down.I use my calendar and journal to remind myself of what I’ve experienced in the past week, or month. I think about those experiences, and see what comes up. Something usually will trigger a sense of discomfort, the question is: is this a singular event or part of a larger pattern?Discomfort can take many forms. Sometimes that discomfort is valuable, often it’s unnecessary. Questions can help me determine the value of my discomfort and if it’s a pattern. Here are some of the questions I ask myself:Would I do this again? Is this a pattern?What am I worried about?What am I stressed about?What am I scared of?What am I tolerating?What am I angry about?What is draining my energy?Next, I write about what comes up. If I’m worried about something, I try to see if there is anything within my control that I can do to reduce my worry. Sometime there isn’t, sometimes there is.When it comes to a pattern of discomfort, one of the only things in my control is to set a boundary. If I’m worried about my health, I have to set work boundaries by communicating with my team. This creates the conditions for rest.If I’m tolerating someone’s poor quality work, I will create a new agreement that clearly states what I will and will not tolerate in order to keep working together. They will either deliver or they won’t. Either way, I will no longer have to tolerate the quality of work.The trick to all of this is consistency. Regularly checking in with ourselves, helps us remain mindful of what is and is not acceptable in our lives. Knowing what is unacceptable helps us create boundaries and a clear vision of what needs to be done now. In some seasons that means replacing pieces of our life that no longer support us. In others, it’s adding entirely new structures to support the growing life we’re now capable of creating.'], ['Circles of Competence: Know Your Strike Zone', 'Ryan Duffy', 'Oct 11', 'https://medium.com/knowable/circles-of-competence-know-your-strike-zone-df6267bd195b?source=home---------148------------------0----------', 'Ted Williams reigns as the greatest pure hitter in baseball history:As if those career numbers aren’t impressive enough, he recorded a hit in 40% of his at-bats during the 1941 season — one of baseball’s most extraordinary feats. To put the magnitude of this accomplishment in context, no other player has joined the .400 Club in the 81 years since. In an age of exponential advancements in sports science, nutrition, training methodology, and equipment technology, his .400 season is the rare sports record that stands the test of time.How did a skinny kid from San Diego immortalize himself in the annals of baseball history?He possessed uncommon talent, of course. But something else set him apart.Long before the advent of sabermetrics (aka “Moneyball”) and the sports world’s obsession with stats and data, Ted Williams was baseball’s first real quant.After each game, he recorded every pitch of every at-bat. Which produced a hit? A strike? A foul? A pop fly? This data-driven understanding of his “sweet spot” gave him more confidence and better odds every time he stepped to the plate.His methodical, precise approach to understanding his competencies has implications far beyond the baseball diamond.Knowing your strike zone — what you do and don’t know — is one of the most powerful ways to get an edge in business, investing, or any walk of life where big success hinges on big decisions.Ted Williams was such an exceptional hitter that he literally wrote the book on it.In 1968, two years after his Hall of Fame induction, he published The Science of Hitting. Unlike the usual post-career athlete’s memoir (he wrote one of those, too), The Science of Hitting is an instruction manual for anyone learning how to hit a baseball. It might not be the breeziest beach read, but it’s still regarded as one of the books ever written for aspiring all-stars.One of the most essential things a batter should know, Williams wrote, is which pitches to swing at and which ones to let pass by.To illustrate this concept — literally — the book includes a diagram of Williams’s strike zone. Subdivided into 77 units, each labeled with a hitting percentage, it’s a heat map for swing choice. This granular, data-driven analysis is typical today, but it was practically unheard of in Williams’s era.He wasn’t just a preternaturally gifted athlete. He was an ahead-of-his-time thinker who understood something most players and coaches of his time didn’t: Baseball is as much a mental game as a physical one.To improve your odds, you have to know when to swing and when not to.By waiting for a pitch in his sweet spot — or as he called it, his “happy zone” — he knew he would get a hit 40% of the time. But if he lost patience and swung at pitches in the lower corners — his cold zones — his odds would be cut by half.Now, let’s take this concept from the baseball field to the field of business.Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most successful investors. Uncoincidentally, he also happens to be a big Ted Williams fan:Williams had his “happy zone.” Buffett has his “circle of competence.”In a world of meme stocks, hype-driven startups, and here today, gone tomorrow business flavors of the month, Buffett’s investment philosophy has never wavered:Critics say he plays it too safe. But his record is undeniable.His company Berkshire Hathway’s stock is up nearly 70,000% over its 30-year history.And if you were to ask him how he does it, he’d tell you it all comes down to staying within his circle of competence.In business and life, knowing what you don’t know can be just as important as knowing what you do.But putting this advice into practice is easier said than done.Fast-moving markets. Endless streams of news and information. Always-on hype machines. FOMO. The world is designed to distract you. And the siren song of the “next big thing” — the one luring you to step outside of your circle — is easy to get stuck in your head.Discipline. Long-term strategy. The humility to admit that you just don’t know. These things take more work. But the most challenging things are the ones most likely to pay off in the long run.Our brains evolved to recognize patterns and solve problems efficiently using mental shortcuts. But these evolutionary advantages come with downsides in the modern world. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a common cognitive bias that leads people to believe they’re smarter than they actually are.It can affect those with experience in a given domain, but it’s most pronounced in those with little to no experience. Why? Because they lack the basic skills to recognize their own incompetence. Or, as Charles Darwin wrote, “Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”Look around and you’ll find examples of the Dunning-Kruger effect everywhere. At the Thanksgiving table where that family member babbles on with misplaced confidence about nuanced political issues. On Twitter where armchair infectious disease “experts” came out of the woodwork during the pandemic. On sports radio where Monday morning quarterbacks absolutely know better than their team’s football coach.Researchers call it a “dual burden.” People are not only incompetent; their incompetence denies them the ability to recognize how inept they really are. They overestimate their skills, fail to recognize the actual skills and expertise that others possess, and fail to recognize their own inadequacies.The Dunning-Kruger effect is equally common among people with a superficial level of competence in a given domain. Passing knowledge inspires misplaced confidence. Or as the British poet and satirist Alexander Pope once wrote, “A little learning is a dangerous thing.”Familiarity is not the same thing as knowledge.The late Richard Feynman is a towering figure in the world of science. A contributor to the Manhattan Project, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, and pioneer in the field of quantum mechanics, he’s among history’s most accomplished and admired thinkers. And he, too, was a believer in the importance of staying within one’s circle or competence.“When it comes to familiarity vs. knowledge,” he said, “you gotta be very careful not to confuse yourself.”In other words, sometimes life’s most powerful words are, “I don’t know.”Everyone wants to have a large circle of competence. The bigger it is, the smarter they are. But knowing the circle’s size is less important than knowing where to find its edges. True mastery is contingent on an understanding of where one’s boundaries of competence are.As Buffett’s longtime business partner Charlie Munger says:When it comes to long-term business strategy, we’re unlikely to get called out on strikes for taking too many pitches — a luxury Ted Williams never enjoyed.Of course, some business decisions do require quick thinking and urgent action. With the pressure of a ticking clock, we’re forced to make imperfect decisions using incomplete information. It’s in these times when knowing where our edges are is most valuable. Even in less-than-ideal circumstances, it can help instill more confidence in our decision making. Our ultimate choices may not always be the right ones, but knowing the boundaries of our circles gives us the best odds that they might be right.When it comes to circles of competence, perfection is not the goal. After all, our circles aren’t “real” things we can touch or feel. They’re abstract models only our mind’s eye can see — constantly growing, shrinking, moving, and overlapping.As Buffett says:In other words, it’s OK to make mistakes. But only when we do so in good faith, not when we let impatience or lack of focus cloud our judgment.Knowing your circle of competence requires humility, discipline, and intellectual honesty.Your goal isn’t to hit the ball with every swing. During his magical 1941 season, Ted Williams missed 60% of the time.Your goal is simply to improve your odds by knowing which pitches to swing at in the first place.“The greatest hitter living can’t hit bad balls good.”For more insights like these, get the Knowable app and join 40,000+ founders, creators, and everyday go-getters building new skills and fueling their ambitions with audio lessons on business, startups, self-improvement, and more from the world’s smartest people.

Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a staple amongst the productivity genre of self-help books. It was written over 30 years ago, yet it remains a best seller, often handed out at offsites or during company onboardings. The key to its success is not just the raw content, but the framework that Stephen uses to present the information:The habits flow from one to the next. The first three are about taking responsibility and aligning your life to achieve your goals. The next three are about effectively working with other people. And the final habit is about the sustainability of your life in pursuit of those goals.While this framework is great, I read this book ten years ago, and I struggle to remember all seven habits.You know what I can remember? Vivid details from Game of Thrones, and I first read that book over 15 years ago. If you are the type of person that can remember half the episodes of The Office but struggle to remember a self-help book, then this post is for you.My intent with this post is to use Tyrion Lannister as a mnemonic device to help you to better remember the seven habits.If you haven’t read or watched Game of Thrones, I don’t recommend reading this post, as there are spoilers ahead. With that being said, here’s a brief reminder of who Tyrion is.Tyrion is the youngest son of the richest man in a war-torn land. As a dwarf, he is dismissed and disdained by a world that values physical prowess over mental acuity (which is Tyrion’s greatest strength). Tyrion is a well-written, flawed character whose proclivity for drink and biting wit made him a fan favorite among the Game of Thrones audience. As an imperfect character, he has many ineffective moments in which not employing the seven habits drives him to ruin. However, in his best moments, there are many parallels between what he does and what Stephen Covey is trying to express.If you like this post, please 👏 , subscribe, or follow me on medium or LinkedIn to let me know I’m on the right track!“Habit 1 is about taking responsibility for your life. Proactive people recognize that they are ‘response-able.’ They don’t blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behaviour. They know they can choose their behaviour. Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find external sources to blame for their behaviour. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and performance, and they blame the weather.”Being proactive is the foundation upon which the other habits rely. The dictionary definition of being proactive is taking action to control your future, but Stephen Covey uses it to mean that you are responsible for your actions and not a victim of other people’s actions. He’s not focused on your ability to control the outcome but rather on your ability to control yourself. Reactive people think in the opposite way, always blaming their circumstances or others for their poor behavior.Let’s look at some cases in which Tyrion was both proactive and reactive.Early on in the books, Tyrion was captured and thrown into the sky cells in the Eyrie. Tyrion could have sat and waited for his brother to come rescue him (which multiple people suggested), but instead, he chose to proactively secure his own freedom. Even when his jailor, Mord, beat him, he refused to let Mord control his response. In the TV series, viewers watch as Tyrion works hard to maintain his composure and stay in control of his responses.Have you ever witnessed a situation at work where one person gets frustrated and raises their voice, and then someone else matches their tone, and the situation escalates? Eventually, things devolve, and no one walks away happy. Imagine how different it would be if they had acted like Tyrion with Mord. Throughout my career, I’ve often coached people on finding the “reasonable response to an unreasonable situation.” This is Tyrion in a nutshell.Now, Tyrion doesn’t always act this way — it was not acting this way that led to his initial downfall. In particular, Tyrion’s family was able to elicit a reactive (non-proactive) response. Joffrey (his nephew) could easily provoke a reaction out of Tyrion. Those reactions led to his being jailed and sentenced to death. It is difficult to remain in control with people you have a history with, which is why family get-togethers can be so stressful. This is probably why Vars and Littlefinger were so much more effective than Tyrion, when it came to Joffrey.When trying to avoid reactive behavior, picture Tyrion reacting to Joffrey. It ruined his life, and reactive behavior can ruin yours. Don’t allow someone else’s actions to control your behavior.When thinking of proactive behavior, picture Tyrion escaping the Sky Cells. When presented with a difficult situation, take control and create the future you want — ideally, one where you survive to fight another day.“Habit 2 is the ability to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes. It is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There is a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation. The physical creation follows the mental, just as a building follows a blueprint.”Stephen Covey’s habits all build upon one another. Proactive people have the drive to seek improvement, and the second habit (begin with the end in mind) ensures that one’s energy is focused on a goal. Without a goal, you are likely to be aimless and unsuccessful. While this sounds straightforward, many people do not start with an end goal in mind, and their hard work never creates the future they want. Once you’ve set an end goal, the next steps are to create a plan (mental creation) and then execute it (physical creation).For the second habit, the best metaphor is the defense of King’s Landing, also known as the battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion proactively took it upon himself to lead the defense of the city (despite constant hindrances from Joffrey and Cersei). Let’s view this from the angle of the second habit:Tyrion’s Goal: Don’t die. This was a simple goal, but very motivational. If the professional world had the same stakes, I think we’d find it much easier to create alignment across teams. Hmm…Tyrion’s Plan: Find a way to defend against vastly superior numbers. Once Tyrion set his goal, he needed a plan that negated Stannis’ superior numbers. Tyrion poured over maps, debated with Varys, and conspired with the pyromancers. He determined where Stannis would attack and how he would compete against superior forces: setting the river on fire (the wildfire explosion).Execution: Don your armor. Finally, the reader’s favorite part — the battle itself.The second habit is not complicated. Being proactive without a goal isn’t going to win the war. Having a goal but no plan won’t help you overcome your enemies. And having a plan that you can’t execute is likely a sign of insanity. To apply the second habit in your life, picture Tyrion trying to stay alive (the goal), pouring over maps (the plan), and fighting on the beach (the execution). Find your King’s Landing and defend it.“Habit 3 is the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. Habit 3 is the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2. Habit 1 says, ‘You are the creator. You are in charge.’ Habit 2 is the first mental creation, based on imagination, the ability to envision what you can become. Habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation.”Proactive people (habit 1) start by choosing a goal (habit 2), and habit 3 is about taking your first steps. I’ve worked with leads who were proactive and knew their goals but poorly prioritized their time — exactly like Ned Stark. He swept into King’s Landing and immediately began making waves. He didn’t prioritize cultivating a solid base and, in the end, was betrayed by the city guard, the small council, and the King. He tried to take a shortcut, and his neck was cut short as a result.In the early books, Tyrion is wavers between being both effective and ineffective. There were two key moments when he became Hand of the King in which he demonstrated he was a keen believer in the fourth habit of putting first things first.(1) Tyrion replaced the commander of the city guard.Tyrion knew that Ned (the former hand of the King) had been betrayed by the commander of the city guard. This betrayal came at a crucial moment and was primarily the reason Ned died. Ned entirely skipped gaining the allegiance of the city guard and assumed that they would follow him because of their morals. While Ned was exceptionally proactive (habit 1), he entirely failed at habits 2 and 3: having a plan and executing it in the correct order.Tyrion was much more thoughtful, and he replaced the commander with Bronn, his (mostly) loyal mercenary companion. The theatrics of the event were great because the audience had no reason to expect this outcome (as the commander had not done anything against Tyrion). Tyrion was proactively fixing the most important problems first.(2) Tyrion identified loyalties amongst the small council.Tyrion planted information about a “secret plan” with three other members of the small council. The rumor was something that his arch-rival (Cersei) would be interested in, but each of the three had a slightly different version of the same rumor. When Cersei confronted him about the rumor, Tyrion immediately knew which council member was the source of the leak. I absolutely loved watching this play out — it was brilliant writing. It was also a perfect example of putting first things first.This was probably the most brilliant maneuver Tyrion ever made, and he followed it up with a blunder that nearly ruined him. Tyrion’s emotions got the better of him (thanks to his toxic family), and he failed to utilize habit 2. Tyrion reacted by throwing Pycelle in prison instead of using him as a known spy. Knowing that Pycelle was the leak, Tyrion could have fed him information to mislead Cersei. He wasn’t thinking about his end goals in this case but rather letting himself be reactive.Mental image: Be like Tyrion with the commander of the city guard and the small council. Do first things first, lest you get beheaded like Ned.“Habit 4 is about seeing life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive one. Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. We both get to eat the pie, and it tastes pretty darn good!”A win-win situation is one in which you seek out solutions that allow both parties to get ahead. People often view situations as a zero-sum game: one party wins, and one party loses. Stephen Covey disagrees with this mindset and instead challenges you to do better.What better example is there of a win-win situation than when Tyrion convinces the hill tribes to fight for him? Tyrion had just escaped from the Eyrie, accompanied by Bronn. The Hill Tribes ambushed them (led by Shagga), yet Tyrion turned the tables. He didn’t just bribe them to let him live; he also convinced them to join him as his personal vanguard. The tribesman got the weapons and plunder they wanted, and Tyrion got his own mini-army.The best example of a win-win I’ve seen in a professional environment was between a product team and my team (the platform team). The product team wanted more features, but my team didn’t have the bandwidth. Instead of fighting, the product team reprioritized its recruiting to hire more platform team members. At the time, this blew my mind. I was fully prepared for a fight, but instead, I got a larger team, and the platform team got its features.Mental image: When in a conflict at work, picture Tyrion and Shagga and think, “how can I create a win-win situation?”“Habit 5 is about how most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. You listen to yourself as you prepare in your mind what you are going to say, the questions you are going to ask, etc. You filter everything you hear through your life experiences, your frame of reference. You check what you hear against your autobiography and see how it measures up. Consequently, you decide prematurely what the other person means before they finish communicating.”One of the things that made Tyrion so formidable (even given his stature) was his willingness to seek understanding. When I think “seek first to understand,” I visualize Tyrion heading north to the wall in the very beginning of the books/show. He wanted to see for himself what the Night’s Watch was all about. He spent time talking to Mormont, Aemon, Benjen, and Jon Snow, all in his quest for understanding. He didn’t try and push an agenda on them or make changes; he was simply there to understand.He used his experience with Mormont to establish trust with his son, Jorah Mormant. Later, he used his experience with Jon Snow to provide advice to Daenerys. My point is that Tyrion sought knowledge and understanding first, and it paid off down the road.I strongly agree with Stephen Covey’s fifth habit, and I think it is the most important. People constantly fail to seek understanding, and in debates, they are just waiting for their chance to speak. I’m absolutely guilty of this. In my experience, the vast majority of conflicts could have been avoided if both parties sought understanding instead of trying to push their own agendas.When you are in a tough situation at work, ask yourself: have you walked the wall like Tyrion, or are you at home in King’s Landing casting judgment from afar?“Habit 6 is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn’t happen on its own. It’s a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table.”In a synergy, you aren’t looking for someone who is the polar opposite of you but rather someone who complements your weaknesses while also adding to your most critical strengths. Throughout the books, George R. Martin repeatedly wove characters together and demonstrated the power of synergy. Examples of these synergistic pairs includeLet’s focus on Tyrion and Bronn, as they are an example of a synergy that Tyrion created in order to advance his career aspirations. Tyrion was well-read, smart, and quick with politics, money, and strategy. However, his physical stature made him a liability in combat. His synergistic pairing was with Bronn. Bronn was a ruthless warrior, far more interested in winning than in being honorable (which suited Tyrion just fine). With Bronn at his back, Tyrion was able to brazenly walk into risky situations that otherwise would have proven fatal for him.In a professional setting, it’s easy to hire people who have the same skills as you instead of hiring against your weaknesses. I think this is because humans have a tendency to artificially inflate other people’s worth if they share our traits or values. However, when building a team, you need to think about your strengths and weaknesses, especially as they relate to problems you are facing.Mental image: Do you have a Bronn who balances out your shortcomings?“Habit 7 is about preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have: you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.”What restorative activities did Tyrion seek outside his role that made him effective?If you hadn’t guessed already, the obvious metaphor for habit 7 would be Shae and Tyrion’s relationship. Tyrion fought most of his battles with his mind (mental), meaning that his restoration needed to be in the physical and emotional arenas. Without going into details, let’s just say that Shae was what Tyrion needed to balance out the rest of his life.The point is that everyone needs a counterbalance in their life that enables them to bring their best self to work. Early in my career, I was a workaholic, and I threw more and more hours into my job. Because so much of my mental stability was wrapped up in my work, conflicts at work would eat away at me. I struggled to maintain the other six habits in my daily behavior because I was mentally drained at all times.My advice for everyone, regardless of where you are in your career, is this: find something outside of work that you can become truly passionate about. It could be a partner, a pet, competitive drag racing — anything that is not your job. You will find it infinitely easier to let go of things at work and remain cool and collected in the face of unreasonable situations.Mental image: Find your Shae.Both the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Game of Thrones are classic books for a reason. Stephen Covey’s book imparts wisdom, and George R. R. Martin’s book is highly memorable. The combination of the two would be a memorable book of wisdom.This blog post is basically the spark-notes for that book:If you enjoyed reading this post, let me know.

Unfortunately, most people totally waste their 1:1 time. The problem: the 1:1s aren’t awkward enough. Here’s how to make them better. (This is part of a series. Check out Part 2 as well!)The 1:1 is a sacred space. It’s intimate. It’s dedicated to just you and the other person. It’s super high bandwidth for complex and uncertain content, especially emotions, hopes, and fears. It’s also the most inefficient way you can devise to disseminate non-controversial info.Very often, people waste most of the 1:1s potential. You might make a little agenda, and then give some updates, some light feedback, and share some complaints. It’s helpful and valuable and nice. But, ask yourself: is the conversation hard? Are you a little nervous or unsure how to get out what you’re trying to say? Is it awkward?Because if it’s not a bit awkward, you’re not talking about the real stuff.You’re not talking about your challenges — how you’re a little burned out and started daydreaming about other jobs and why. Or that you’re scared about not making progress on a growth area, whether because it seems a bit B.S. or just because you don’t know how. You’re not confessing that you have to plan for an hour for each of these 1:1s and be super careful not to say something wrong. You’re not saying you know you’re both frustrated about the project, but you really want to work it out.You don’t tell them the good stuff , because it feels silly. Like how they made your whole week with a simple “Great job!” after the talk you gave. Or how you went home and bragged to your partner about it. Or, how you’re so grateful how their care and empathy got you through a really rough patch. Or how they inspire you with how good they are at a skill. You’re not asking: “Why do I totally flop when I try to copy what you do? What am I missing?”All of those things would be really awkward. So you don’t say them.Obviously, not every minute of every 1:1 can be like this. But make no mistake — you should have enough awkward in you to use up a chunk of each meeting. This is what solves problems that otherwise go unsolved. It breaks the cycle of repeated issues or an impasse. It lets you be you and let down your guard. It builds trust and relationships. It creates growth for both of you.Change and growth are always awkward — embrace that.A few years ago, as an engineer, I used to dread and avoid awkward conversations like the plague because they were very uncomfortable. Then, very slowly, I realized I was wasting a rare precious resource: one-on-one time with another person. Now I instead dread bland, vapid, cookie cutter 1:1s. I fear that we’ll talk for a while but never get to anything real.I made the change by committing to be awkward. Here are the two rules I use for every 1:1, many times a week:Of course, I hate to have to say this, but I will: don’t be awkward in the wrong way. Nobody wants to hear your TMI story or off-color joke. It’s awkward, but it doesn’t count.These two rules are transformative. Following them is oddly liberating and effective. We’ve had great success teaching this to whole teams, breaking them up into pairs, and sending them off to come up with one awkward thing each to say to each other.If you want to join me and get going on this, here’s some tips to help you unleash the vast sea of awkwardness that resides within each one of us (maybe especially so in tech), just waiting to be released.If you’re not sure you want to take the risk to get started — ask yourself: “How often am I too awkward vs. not awkward enough?” and check out Make The Other Mistake.Awkwardness is hard at first, but it really does get easier. As with anything, the key is slightly uncomfortable practice. But, there’s something that makes that practice easier: whenever you succeed getting something awkward out and survive, it creates a huge feeling of satisfaction and relief. It’s deeply positive to have another person hear you and understand you better.So, to aid your practice, here’s a long list of guaranteed awkward and positive things to help you get started. I hope that majority of these will work with most of the people you have 1:1s with!If you liked this, please click the 💚 below so others can enjoy.

Get a New Job!” in which the author argues that none of the current solutions including degrowth, carbon taxes, minimalism, veganism, and population reduction, among others will work because they require people to choose against their desires and they require leaders to rise above the system to make changes that are good for the planet.The author argues that the only way to solve climate change is for all of us to get new jobs that create renewable energy, otherwise, we are all part of the problem.Others take a more fatalistic point of view. For example in an article for the New Yorker, author Jonathan Franzen said “We literally are living in end times for civilization as we know it… We are long past the point of averting climate catastrophe.”So is all of this doom and gloom warranted? Yes, we are facing some extreme challenges and things are likely to get worse before they get better, but are we as Franzen says “Living in the end of times?”In this article, I argue that climate doomism is overly simplistic, unscientific, and based on suppositions, not facts or data. It also shows a lack of understanding of the complexity of climate change and a lack of acknowledgment of the solutions being implemented and the changes that are occurring.According to Michael E. Mann, arguably the most prominent climate scientist on the planet, “If the science objectively demonstrated it was too late to limit warming below catastrophic levels, that would be one thing and we scientists would be faithful to that. But science doesn’t say that.”Climate doomisim is just as bad as denialism as it leads to inaction. After all, what’s the point in eating less meat, flying less, or taking public transport if our demise is imminent? We might as well throw a giant house party in one last hurrah if we are going the way of the dodo bird anyway.While I am not saying that extinction isn’t a possibility, if we do nothing, the likelihood goes from a possibility to an inevitability if we sit around saying “we’re all doomed.” Subscribing to this fatalistic view also leads to anxiety, and an anxious mind has a harder time solving problems.Climate doom doesn’t make you smart, it doesn’t make you cool, it makes you an even bigger part of the problem. Because it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Henry Ford famously said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t you’re right.” If you spend enough time with a climate doomer, their attitude will infect you as well, this is known as emotional contagion, and left unchecked it can spread like a virus, and lead to climate apathy.Reducing meat consumption, population reduction, carbon taxes, minimalism, and degrowth are not meant to be stand-alone solutions to climate change. Rather they are meant to be contributing factors to solving a very big and complex puzzle. Implementing them will buy us time until new technology, changes in social norms, and a better understanding of how nature works can offer us more complete solutions.For example, studies show that If everyone went vegan, only a quarter of current farmland would be needed. However, it is unrealistic to expect the whole world to quit eating meat, so what if we just reduced our consumption of meat and cheese?Skipping a steak just once a week with your family would reduce emissions equivalent to taking your car off the road for nearly three months. If the entire U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week: We’d reduce emissions equivalent to not driving 91 billion miles — the same as taking 7.6 million cars off the road.What if we didn’t give up all meat but just the worst culprits like beef and lamb? According to a study by the World Resources Institute, this would lead to a per capita food and land use-related greenhouse gas emissions reduction of between 15 and 35 percent by 2050. Going vegetarian could reduce those per capita emissions by half. It would also reduce deforestation while supporting biodiversity, which would have a synergistic effect.The point is that we don’t have to solve climate change all at once. We need to slow it down to give technology and society enough time to evolve. Solving climate change will not be an event, it will be a process that takes place over decades and some of the solutions that are being proposed today will age out, as nascent technologies mature to take their place.For example, if we cut down on our meat consumption now, by 2035 it’s projected that “alternative meats,” which include cell and plant-based meats, will be a $290 billion industry making up to 22% of the market share. If we put a sin tax on industrially grown meat to make producers pay for their negative externalities, this would speed up the mass adoption of alternative meats even more, allowing people to have their steak and eat it too, so to speak.In a new report, experts from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and sustainability-focused investing group Blue Horizon show that creating alternative proteins reduced emissions the most per dollar spent. Plant-based proteins were three times more cost-effective than sustainable cement and nearly 15 times more efficient than green power. The researchers called alternative proteins “one of the low-hanging fruit in the fight against climate change.”Some might say that people won’t cut down on meat and dairy, but the data says otherwise.A 2018 survey from Johns Hopkins claims that two-thirds of Americans are already cutting down on their meat consumption. A 2021 survey shows that more than 47% of Americans see themselves as flexitarians who are trying to eat a more plant-based diet and it’s even higher (54%) in those aged 18–39.The same thing is happening in Europe where almost one-third no longer consider themselves to be full-time meat-eaters and it’s projected that 25% of the UK population will be vegan or vegetarian by 2025.Coincidentally studies show that it takes just 25% of a population for a social movement to reach a tipping point to establish a new norm. The researchers point to recent legal and societal shifts in workplace sexual harassment, gay marriage, gun laws, racism, and gender equality as evidence that social norms do change.A 2021 survey from the Pew Research Center shows that 80% of people are willing to make changes to how they work and live to reduce the effects of global climate change, which means we are already well past this tipping point and the evidence is showing that behaviors are starting to change.For example, net emissions have been dropping in most developed economies including some of the largest CO2 emitters such as the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom, where total emissions have been falling since 2005. In high-income countries the overall fall has been about 18%, in the US it was 18.4% but the UK has seen an almost 45% drop.These drops have occurred without aggressive climate policies. Rather they have come mainly from improved technology which has led to greater energy efficiency and a shift away from coal-fired electricity generation to natural gas and renewables. Just think about how much quicker this can happen if our leaders and communities took a more aggressive approach to climate activism.Another important tipping point we have surpassed is for mass adoption of EVs, wind, solar and batteries. History shows us that for a disruptive technology to become mainstream it takes between 3–5% of the market share to be accepted. This has been true for the adoption of cars, mobile phones, and electric lighting among other things.The data shows us that the US, China, and Europe have all surpassed the 5% threshold for EVs. In 2021 wind and solar made up 10% of global energy, which also puts us far past the tipping point. With solar growing by 23% over the year before and wind growing by 14%.Part of the reason for the increase is because of the massive decline in the cost of producing solar panels, which has become the most inexpensive form of electricity in history, as of 2020. Just ten years ago, this was thought impossible and even the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast just a quarter of the amount of solar energy that was installed in 2020. The reason for this failed prediction was that the organization didn’t take into account the greater sums of investment, which led to increases in efficiency and a precipitous drop in prices.The common argument doomers like to make against EVs and renewable energy is that rare earth minerals have to be mined, and solar panels and wind turbines aren’t recyclable, which means that we are just transferring pollution from the air to the ground.While this is true, again it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how technology works, as well as a lack of imagination. For example, biomining is a way to extract minerals using plants (phytomining) and/or microbes. You see rare-earth minerals are not all that rare. It’s just that they occur in such small amounts in rock and soil that we need to resort to blowing up mountains and drilling underground to extract them. But if plants and microbes, which don’t make salary demands, can do it, then it makes these minerals much more accessible. This technology exists today, it just needs to be scaled.Then there is the fact that in August of 2022, a company announced the first recyclable wind turbine, whose resin can be turned into (strangely enough) gummy bears and other products. Solar panels are already 80% recyclable, it’s just that the current technology makes it labor-intensive and expensive to do. However, since solar panels last 25 to 50 years that gives us a lot of time to innovate to make them more efficient.Again, we don’t have to solve climate change all at one go, we just need to buy ourselves some time until science and technology evolve enough so that we can reduce or eliminate our emissions and pollution.The speed at which technology improves is something else that many climate doomers fail to understand. Because of Moore’s Law, we are seeing improvements in synthetic biology (think bio-mining and cell-based meats), material science AI, and energy at increasingly faster rates.Add to this record amounts of capital being invested into mitigating climate change, which has grown by 210% to $87.5 billion, invested into 3000 climate tech startups, between 2020 to 2021, according to the consultancy PWC.This has led to improved efficiency in solar panels, which are at 25% up from 20% just a few years ago; carbon neutral jet fuel; carbon neutral concrete; and growable buildings from mycelium.Exponential technology will eventually lead us to nuclear fusion, which could meet the global demand for clean free energy. However, the joke amongst physicists is that fusion is always 30 years away. This time experts agree that it really is just 20 to 30 years away.There are two reasons for this belief. The first is that in December 2021 for the first time in history scientists created a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used, a huge milestone. The second reason is that by 2025 ITER, (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) will come online. Located in the south of France, it will be the largest fusion reactor ever built and is a collaboration between 35 countries at an estimated cost of 22 billion Euros.Exponential technology has also given us a better understanding of nature. More data has shown us the importance of maintaining a healthy microbiome in the soil to prevent droughts and improve the nutrients in our food. We now understand the role mangroves play in preventing floods, keeping the oceans clean, and sequestering carbon. We now know that whales absorb huge amounts of CO2 in their bodies, and their poo acts as fertilizer for plankton, which has absorbed 40% of the CO2 ever produced. Just increasing plankton production by 1% is the equivalent of planting 2 billion trees.While there are still plenty of challenges left, the good news is that according to a review published in the journal Nature, global fishing is becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In some places like Tampa Bay, Florida, and the Philippines, the habitats are being restored. According to the review, the ocean can repair itself and scientists estimate that with enough effort the oceans can fully recover by 2050, in just one generation.Even the Great Barrier Reef which has seen substantial damage from mass bleaching events and crown of thorns starfish has reported some good news. Between August 2021 and May 2022, a survey of 87 reefs found that the average hard coral cover in the upper region and central areas of the reef increased by around one-third, the highest amount of coral cover since the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) began monitoring 36 years ago.Although this doesn’t mean we are out of the woods yet, it does mean that coral reefs are capable of repairing themselves and if we assist them with a little help from science they can do so even quicker.Despite record-breaking fires, droughts, and disease even our forests are not beyond saving. However, while planting trees as a means to stop climate change has been in the news a lot, the latest science counsels against this in favor of a more natural approach called rewilding. This natural method of regrowing trees is also faster and makes more biodiverse healthier forests. Since it is also cheaper and less labor intensive, it is a much more scalable solution than planting.However, technology is only part of the solution, and there are a lot of developments that doomers fail to acknowledge. For example in August 2022 a $370 billion climate bill passed, making it the single largest American investment to slow global warming by reducing demand for fossil fuels.The bill invests money over 10 years in the form of tax credits that steer consumers toward electric vehicles and push utility companies toward renewable energy sources. Energy experts say that the bill could help to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 2005 levels, which puts the country in striking distance of meeting its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030.On July 28, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly declared the ability to live in “a clean, healthy and sustainable environment,” a universal human right. Although the declaration is not legally binding, resolutions like this have in the past served as a foundation for effective treaties and national laws.Shortly after the UN declaration, several citizens from Germany sued their own government. The plaintiffs, some of which are filing on behalf of their children, claim the right to breathe clean air is a human right that should be upheld by their government.In fact, since 2015, over 1,000 climate-related court cases have been brought by citizens against their governments and corporations around the world to fight for a cleaner planet.These lawsuits are gaining traction. For example on May 26, 2021, a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030 from the 2019 levels. That includes emissions from vehicles that burn Shell’s gasoline.The same day the Dutch court ruled on Shell’s case Exxon shareholders, along with the world’s largest investment fund manager, Blackrock, voted to oust three board members to replace them with experts in renewable energy and climate science.In 2012 Unity College in Maine became the first university to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. By 2015, fossil fuel divestment became the fastest-growing divestment movement in history and by October 2021, 1,485 institutions totaling $39.2 trillion in assets committed to or had already divested from the fossil fuel industry.Several major cities including San Francisco, New York, Boston, London, Mexico City, Barcelona, Madrid, Oslo, Brussels, Copenhagen, Paris, Milan, Athens, and Rome were already restricting cars in the central business districts to fight climate change and make the areas more livable, pre-COVID-19. The pandemic has accelerated this trend and has highlighted our basic human need to have open outdoor spaces.The ban on cars has resulted in cleaner air, reduced pedestrian deaths, lower obesity rates, fewer stress-related diseases, and additional space for housing, parks, trees, plants biking, and walking paths. Furthermore, business has improved, in the areas where the streets are closed. For example, London saw an increase in retail spending of 30% at shops and restaurants. Studies show that walkable streets are more economically productive per acre and property values thrive.Other major cities like Paris, Madrid, Ottawa, Seattle, and Melbourne are turning their densely packed downtown areas into so-called 15-minute cities in which cars are banned or limited and all essential services are strategically placed within walking or biking distance.A recent report from the Center for London shows that reduced traffic neighborhoods are one of the easiest ways to save money, improve health and make cities quieter.In over a dozen cities and counties throughout the United States and Canada, including Bakersfield, Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, Monterey County, Mendocino County, Grand Forks (North Dakota), and Fort Worth as well as several communities in Hawaii, have taken a similar approach by implementing Blue Zones Project. This redesigns cities to make them more livable, by adding bike paths, improving and adding parks, and trees, encouraging more plant-based eating, creating greater opportunities for community engagement, and making them more pedestrian-friendly.The results? A 14% reduction in obesity, a 30% reduction in smoking, lower healthcare costs, less employee absenteeism, and, a generally happier community. So, reducing car usage not only has environmental benefits, but economic and health benefits as well.Climate doomism is as damaging as climate denialism because it promotes inaction and is counterproductive. There is nothing in the scientific literature that says climate change is an intractable problem, provided that we work towards solutions, rather than shrugging our shoulders with a defeatist attitude.Fear promotes anxiety, which leads to inaction. If you want to do something to fight climate change then educate yourself about solutions and elevate the consciousness of the people around you.Remember it takes just 25% of a population to hit the tipping point for a social movement to become a societal norm. The interesting thing about the study is that in experiment after experiment if they were just 1% below that 25% mark, the movement failed. Because we are connected through emotional contagion if you are a climate doomer, you are affecting the people around you. So, the question you have to ask yourself is, do you want to be part of the problem or do you want to be part of the solution?For some ideas on how you can be part of the solution please read The Most Important Thing You Can Do to Fight Climate Change and 10 Ways to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint.'], ['Nature Speaks: How Environmental Linguistics may help save the planet.', 'K.

Marta Kongarayeva, born 1930, was among the very last speakers of a language called Tofa. Having dwelled in the forest her entire life, Marta also inhabited a linguistic world that rendered it legible. She named subtle, yet meaningful, signs: tiny flowers blooming on the forest floor, insect chirps, lunar phases, swirly patterns in lake ice, the creak of cedar cones disgorging their nuts.Nature spoke to Marta, telling her the lunar calendar days, when to gather nuts, where to hunt, and how to survive. And Marta spoke back to nature in her Tofa language, invoking the bear to fatten itself for the kill, offering tea to the campfire god for success in hunting, whistling the wood grouse to the hunter’s snare, or serenading a reindeer to nurse her calf. Marta’s lyrical dialogue with nature — which she knew to be capable of both benevolence and severity — was a spiritual practice that kept the world in balance and allowed her Tofa people to thrive in one of the harshest climes on earth. Marta’s Tofa language uniquely expresses “I’ll catch a quail” as a single verb (üšpülläär) and “my two-year-old male castrated domes- ticated rideable reindeer” as a single noun (charym). She could recite twenty Tofa words exclusively denoting body parts of a bear (irezang). Marta knew the name of each bend in the river, directional words that applied only to rivers, and the names of water spirits. These language tools allowed her to wayfind in the forest, harvesting its bounty while respecting its power.Without walking with Marta and listening to her wisdom, it would be hard to grasp her linguistically encoded environmental knowledge (or LEEK, as I call it). Contemplating the forest with an elder, you witness how knowledge springs up from the land, trickles into the observant mind, and is absorbed by cultural practice. It can then be applied to sway nature to human will and to augur its patterns. This seems like magic to someone like me who comes from a culture thoroughly detached from nature and lacks the lexicon of the forest. In fact, it is science, millennia of keen observation and cultural sense-making by astute, nature-attuned minds.Language infuses every environment. Through language, people generate and transmit astounding bodies of nature knowledge, mostly unwritten and stored only in memory. The application of this knowledge creates feedback loops that link human perception and behavior with plants, animals, and non-living elements. How then can one practice environmental studies, ecology, or biological sciences without including and respecting the knowledge base found in the world’s 7,000+ languages, and especially in smaller Indigenous tongues?Linguistic science has much to offer us in understanding climate change, biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. But this is a different ilk of linguistics than what has dominated the academy for the past half century. I’ll call it Environmental Linguistics, a re-attachment of language to nature. For Indigenous peoples, these two were never parted.I went to Siberia to do field linguistics, intending to create a grammar, dictionary, and story collection of Tofa. Grammar, so we are taught in contemporary linguistics, may be extracted from speakers’ minds, captured in recordings, and analyzed for science. As a newly-minted PhD from Yale, I’d had superb theoretical training. But on my walks with Marta, I realized her language did not exist apart from its forest habitat. My training and tools were unfit for the task. Tofa makes little sense in a library or a digital archive— or in Stalinist labor camps where Marta’s friend Varvara Adamova had been exiled just for speaking it. The intimate environmental knowledge Tofa encodes is nonportable, untranslatable, and exists nowhere else on the planet, nor in the minds of any other people. Although I had some nifty analytical tools from linguistics and anthropology, these had not prepared me to grasp the complexity, connectedness, and value Tofa holds for its speakers.Language HotspotsRecently, I’ve been exploring the language-environment interface in the South Pacific, a place remarkably different from Siberia. Vanuatu’s lush tropical islands are home to a self-confident people enjoying the bounty of the sea while managing tourism that showcases their pristine coral reefs and daring land-divers. Vanuatu boasts astonishing bio-diversity, and it’s the world’s #1 “Language Hotspot” (a term I coined in 2007 for the National Geographic Society to help visualize global patterns of language diversity). The Ni-Vanuatu people — a population of just 250,000 — boast a higher ratio of languages to people than anywhere on earth. They can express themselves in one or more of 113 local tongues, as well as Bislama, French, and English.On Futuna Island, I met Anselon Seru, in his mid-20s and renowned for his fishing expertise. Showing off a prized tuna (uorukago) he had netted from his wooden outrigger canoe (waka), Anselon paused to upload a photo of it to Instagram. When I turned on my recorder, Anselon easily named more than 250 species of fish and described their feeding habits, migration patterns, and schooling formations. Many Futuna fish names do not map one-to-one onto the Linnaean scientific taxonomy used by marine biologists. Rather, the Futuna apply a cultural logic of classification and naming that they find apt. For example, two fish that appear identical to a marine biologist and share just one scientific name are called by two distinct names in Futuna, because one sleeps in the daytime and the other at night. To fish, one must also sail, and so I listened as expert navigator Yaugane Misikofe taught the young men the names of 18 winds that make up the Futuna wind compass, a crucial tool for making landfall.On nearby Keamu island, elder David Nasauman taught me the sugar cane calendar, each month named for a different cane variety. David’s son, Wopa Nasauman, named the dozen plant species he had turned into rope, thatch, and posts to build his cyclone house. Martial Wahe explained the eight life stages of the coconut, and Ruben Neriam named thousands of plants, many with curative properties. As part of a five-year project called “Plants mo pipol blong Vanuatu” (Plants and People of Vanuatu), I am working with the Vanuatu Forestry Department and with New York Botanical Garden scientists Michael Balick and Gregory Plunkett to document this valuable knowledge.The foundation for our scientific work is the knowledge base of the Vanuatu people, which they retain as intellectual property while generously sharing. As the botanists collect specimens of nearly 2,000 plants entirely new to modern science, we find that almost every plant is known, named, and used by local people. As Takaronga Kuautonga of Futuna Island remarked: “We have names for all these plants in our language.”Globalization pros and consThese remote communities — in Siberia and Vanuatu — are now within range of cell towers and are active on social media. Eager technologizers, they are crossing the digital divide and creating an online presence for tongues never before heard outside a few isolated villages. They do this intentionally, viewing technology not as a threat but an opportunity. By leveraging the positive value of globalization, they visibilize their cultures, inviting the appreciation of a global audience. They also add to the sum of recorded environmental knowledge.Languages are endangered because they have been conquered, colonized, and oppressed and are now dominated by major global tongues. Tofa is nearing a vanishing point, with a dozen elderly speakers left. As Marta Kongarayeva told me: “Old age is creeping up on me, and soon I’ll go berry-picking. When I go, I’ll take my lan- guage with me.” Futuna counts over 1,000 speakers but is potentially threatened as young people migrate off the island. Both scenarios are sources of concern met with active interventions by community leaders and by outsiders invited to assist.Hope amidst crisisThe world is at a crucial juncture, as it stands to lose an immense portion of its plant, animal, and cultural diversity during this century. Threats to the natural environment are driven by climate change and unsustainable lifestyles. Small languages are falling into oblivion as major global languages expand to dominate human thought and discourse. Saving species from extinction, adapting to climate change, and assisting communities in revitalizing their languages are urgent, yet intertwined efforts.As Neil McKenzie of the Yawuru people of Australia explained to me while demonstrating survival skills in the outback, “If I don’t show you the land, you won’t understand the language. It exists because of the land. It is in close harmony with it.”A sign of hope that we may yet learn to create a sustainable civilization is that humans have done so before, many times over: the Yawuru in their deserts, the Tofa in their Siberian forests, and the Ni-Vanuatu on their bountiful islands. Their languages—and the unique knowledge these encode—enable their survival. These Environmental Linguists have much to teach us, if we will listen. What they know may help save the planet.—K.

I want to get all the information out on the table without judgement and look at it through various lenses.I do my best to avoid bias and understand everyone’s perspective. I have learned how to take it all in and weigh the pieces, and whatever conclusions I draw, I do my best to be conscious of how the news will be received.I’ve been in the field for 10 years, and I’ve started mentoring lately. In the last year I’ve gotten more and more requests to offer recommendations, look at portfolios, and critique first-timers’ resumes.I sometimes wonder if these newbs (yes, condescending, I told you that I took off my diplomacy hat!) really understand what they’re getting themselves into.So here is my least diplomatic way of explaining what it’s like to be a UX researcher.Buckle up.Yeah, okay, so if you’re a professional researcher, chances are good that you’re better than most people at looking at all the little pieces of data and finding the connections, themes, trends, patterns, etc.But those aren’t the dots I’m talking about.I’m talking about the stakeholders across the business, product management, design, and development.All of those people are their own little dots. Silos. Islands. They’re out there, doing their design thing or their business thing. And they miiiiiight be interested in what you’re doing on your research island.I’ve talked before about the importance of research leading to action, because I don’t want to do research just for the sake of doing it. I want to watch the research light a fire under my stakeholders’ asses so they go fix the damn thing that customers just spent hours bitching about.And to get that to happen, I’ve had to spend way more time understanding the politics, funding, and motives underlying my projects. I’ve had to ask questions that sometimes feel super disconnected to the project I’m being asked to do. I’ve had to think through the audience I’m reporting findings back to and figure out what they control and what pressures are on them so that maybe they actually DO the thing that the research says they should do.It’s tedious and sorta exhausting, but when you take those extra steps, you can connect the dots between what you did and what they need to do. It gives your work more power and impact.I’ve conducted moderated interviews for years. I’ve watched hundreds — honestly, it’s probably thousands — of unmoderated user tests. I’ve read thousands of open-ended comments on surveys. I even used to get occasional direct messages from members of a customer panel I managed.Sometimes I get a few stakeholders to observe interviews, but it’s never 100% attendance; most show up to about 25% of sessions. I’ve had one — literally, ONE — product manager ask me for the raw data from a survey so they could read all the open-ended comments for herself (and I think she’s a rock star for it — go, Bianca!).Occasionally, users say something wonderful, or they react positively to whatever site, app, or prototype is being tested, and I love those moments. I still remember a gentleman who was using a note keeping app to organize his adoption documents with his partner, and how we literally cried when I wished him well at the end of the session. I still wonder if he ever got to be a parent, and hope like hell that it was everything he dreamed it would be.But of course most UX research is focused on rooting out pain points, and that means you have to experience a lot of emotional pain by proxy.I’ve had customers lose their shit in user tests. Sometimes I have to give interviewees a minute to collect themselves when we cover sensitive topics. One tester spent literally 18 minutes of an unmoderated test completely STUCK, because she overlooked a tiny carrot icon in the upper left corner of the screen; I was shouting FOR her by the time she finally found the damn thing. Testers have lectured me on how the company ought to run things, and they harp on how shitty they’re being treated. I’ve even been accused of taking food out of their kids’ mouths.And most of the time, they’re not even wrong. I get where they’re coming from. I feel their pain.I have to soften the tones, avoid using certain clips, or maybe blip out bad words to keep stakeholders from getting defensive or casting the user aside — because they’re obviously an outlier. I end up swallowing down the hardest bits of feedback because they get in the way of the team taking action.It happens a few times a year: leadership doesn’t like the direction a design is going, or the product manager is skeptical that the most important element will be overlooked, or a hedge case someone didn’t think of brings a whole project to a screeching halt.People disagree, start picking fights, and obsess about all the little what-ifs until someone says, “let’s get some actual users to look at it.”Then they bring me in to scope out the project. I start to get a lay of the land.But when the tension becomes clear, I’ve got to set up side conversations and chat threads and email chains. I once was involved in a chain of emails that got so complicated that the boss’s boss’s boss had to tell everyone to stop replying to the thread and pick it up Monday. (I never thanked her for that. I really should.)I’ve learned to sniff out when research actually IS what will break the stalemate and get the ball rolling again. It’s nice when that happens. But that’s usually only about half the time.The other half of the time, I end up feeling caught between 2 parents who aren’t speaking to each other. I have to treat certain team members more carefully and layer in my extra-strength diplomacy skills to break the tension.I’ve had to learn how suppress the urge to roll my eyes and shout, “Why can’t we all just get along?!” Get ready for that.I did some testing for a fancy food delivery company — the kind of place where you might buy a big box of steaks and pre-made sides for Father’s Day or gourmet lava cakes for your sister’s birthday.Every tester got to checkout and immediately complained about the pop-up offer trying to upsell them on adding 1–2 more things to their cart. We pretty much all hate those things, they’re a pain in the ass.But when I reported it back to my stakeholders, they were basically like, “We know, we hear it all the time. But it works; people DO add more at the last minute and boost the average order value.”Cue my eye roll.It’s a fair point. We don’t just build what the end users want. We also have to consider what the business wants.Unfortunately, that means that UX researchers have to listen to the same complaint, again and again, with the knowledge that their complaints will never be addressed.At one job, we referred to these pain points as the “known knowns”. They had their own page in our internal web site.After a while, you go numb to it. You get tired of hearing it. You get frustrated with the fact that the pain points aren’t addressed. So you move on and find a new customer base. You last a couple of years before the same ol’ known knowns start showing up, and then you dust off the resume.Bottom line…I’m good at it.I’ve got a higher-than-average emotional intelligence score, so I’m good at reading people and responding accordingly. (Testers and stakeholders alike.)By extension, that means I have an easier time understanding my stakeholders and crafting stories and deliverables that meet them where they’re at.Not only am I good at connecting dots, but I genuinely enjoy doing it. There’s something deeply satisfying about staring hard at data and teasing the answers out of it. There’s something immensely gratifying when you see recommendations from your research show up in the product roadmap.My skills of diplomacy make it easier to manage stakeholders and tease out the underlying influences and impacts a project will have.And because of all of that stuff^, when I talk, people listen. I interviewed for a job a couple years ago, and after presenting some examples of my work, one of the interviewers told me, “You made me NOT want to multi-task!”It might be the best compliment I’ve ever received.Okay so look, if you’ve made it this far, there’s a good chance you’re an aspiring UX researcher. And if I haven’t frightened you off, GOOD. Go kick ass.If the reasons I like being a UX researcher don’t sound like you, NO WORRIES. There are lots of researchers out there that are awesome at their jobs and absolutely nothing like me. Go be one of those, and kick even MORE ass.And to all readers, I’d like to thank you for reading this unfiltered take on my work. I hope it’s been entertaining, and that I haven’t caused offense. You have my genuine apologies if I did. I promise to keep my diplomacy hat on for most of my other posts.Most, but not all. ;)'], ['The Improbability of Aliens and Literature', 'Nir Zicherman', 'Oct 4', 'https://medium.com/@NirZicherman/the-improbability-of-aliens-and-literature-6e9f18e11e83?source=home---------196------------------0----------', 'In 1961, American astrophysicist Frank Drake had a breakthrough. He realized that, in the nascent and oft-ridiculed search for extraterrestrial intelligence, there was a concrete scientific conversation waiting to be had. While the field was abuzz with philosophical, speculative thoughts, he sat down and wrote out this formula:Today, this formula is known as the Drake Equation, in his honor. The math it represents could not be simpler. The Drake Equation is simply a straightforward product of some inputs. It takes in a handful of variables and spits out a single number. That single number, which he called N, represents the number of intelligent, sophisticated alien civilizations in our galaxy, the Milky Way.The Drake Equation is a bottoms-up probabilistic argument for the likelihood of our being alone in the universe (or more accurately, in our galaxy).The component variables of the equation are:There is significant debate and wild margins of error associated with each variable. Reputable estimates for the output N range from 0.00000000000091 (i.e. we’re very alone in our galaxy) to over 15,000,000 (i.e. we’re not alone at all).A couple of months ago, I wrote an article that looked at how mathematically improbable it is that great art even exists in the first place. Recently, while reading about the Drake Equation, I thought about the similarities between the concepts.At its core, the Drake Equation is a way of breaking down a higher level problem into its component parts. I’m a huge fan of thinking about things as funnels. So with this framework in mind, I started to think about art, and specifically literature, to see how we could think about the same problem but just replace the concept of aliens with books.What would the Drake Equation be if, rather than asking how likely/unlikely it is that extraterrestrial life exists, it asked how likely/unlikely it is that great literature exists?We can think of the variables at play as being pretty similar to what Drake originally envisioned. I’ll use simpler variable names to make the formula more accessible.And so, if you multiple w*i*d*s*f*r*c*p, what you get is also an N. And what this N represents is the total number of books available to be read in the world.Unlike in the original Drake Equation, where we’re trying to figure out what the output is based on inputs, the output here is theoretically knowable. The more interesting analysis is to look not at the output but at the various inputs, and at how much room there is to improve each one of those numbers.For instance, the democratization of self-publishing tools and channels has drastically changed the variable above that I call p. Higher in the funnel, the fraction of people who complete drafts once started, f, has also been rising due to the amazing resources available out there for writers (many of which exist on Medium!). And higher in the funnel still, the initial spark to turn an idea into a book, d, feels more realistic now than ever, in a world in which we’re surrounded by creators of all types who did just that.And while these numbers are higher than they once were, there is so much more room to grow. Simply by increasing each of these fractions by a slight degree, as with any conversion funnel, we can drastically raise the number of books, N, that get published as a result.Toni Morrison once wrote, “If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to write it.” I believe that if more people took her advice, we’d be able to collectively skew that output of the Drake Equation for Literature ever-so-slightly higher. And the world of literature (and therefore the world at large) would be better off for it.P.S. There is something else that is arguably just as important than N, both in the original Drake Equation and in this new one. Just because a book or an alien civilization exists doesn’t mean we will ever find it. And so, just as the thought-provoking Fermi Paradox asks why, given the likely existence of aliens, we haven’t yet found any, I’d be curious to ask the same question of many of the great undiscovered books out there. There is massive room for innovation in building products and technology that will help enable us all to discover those unfound gems. I’m very fortunate to have a job where I get to work on exactly that.'], ['Three Rules of Solving Problems', 'Yonatan Zunger', 'Jul 11', 'https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/three-rules-of-solving-problems-355944d34c9a?source=home---------205------------------0----------', 'There are a couple of “standard spiels” I have been giving my teams for decades at this point; I’m working on writing them down to make them more accessible. These three rules are probably the ones that I repeat the most often. I often call them rules of “design,” but really these are tools for solving problems of any sort — from machine to human.T\\nhere are three rules that I repeat to my teams often, usually several times a week, about how to solve problems. Each one of them is superficially simple, even trite, but when you dig into what it means to follow them, you realize that they are often counterintuitive and require active effort on your part. But my experience is that, when followed, they make it possible to solve seemingly intractable problems.The three rules are, in descending order of importance:Here is a brief explanation of each of their meanings, wrapped up with a story about fencing that may explain why I chose these three.If there is only one thing you remember from this essay, let it be this; I have found it to be completely essential in actually solving anything. It seems simple and obvious, but following it can be surprisingly challenging.The key word in this, the one that isn’t as obvious as it looks, is “then.” There is an order to these steps and it is vitally important to not conflate them.When you are trying to solve a problem, it’s perpetually tempting to consider where you are now — all of the current situations, the tradeoffs you’ve historically made, the things you’ve discovered you’re good at, the things your customers have historically loved — and ask “how can I adjust what I’m doing to make things better?” And this seems like an obviously right thing to do.The problem with this is that, if you plan this way, you are also implicitly planning around all of the bad things in where you are today. You’re looking at the best small changes from where you are, which may not lead you anywhere close to where you actually want to be. It’s like walking around in a maze: the turn that takes you most towards the exit isn’t necessarily the turn that will actually get you to the exit. Much more likely, it will take you down a chain of successively better approximations that finish at a dead-end.In engineering projects, I’ve seen this over and over: teams make a series of small changes, not realizing that the system they’ve built is no longer serving even the basic needs of their customers, and those customers who are staying are only doing so because they themselves fear the cost of change — something which they keep doing until one day, they don’t. And then the customers leave, and you have no way to get them back, because you haven’t made any investments in getting to where you actually need to be.The way you avoid this is to clearly distinguish the two steps. First, figure out where you want to be: What are the problems that need solving? Who cares that you solve them? What do they actually want out of a solution? What would a good solution look like? The counterintuitive trick, the thing that feels like you’re cheating or even “doing engineering wrong,” is to do a clean-sheet design, completely ignoring what you have, constraining yourself only by what you are capable of doing without reference to what you have. The output of that is a clear picture of where you want to be. Only once you have that picture clear in your head do you ask how you should move from here to there — which is now a much more concrete question, and often quite different from how you would have moved if you were just tweaking your current solution.Being more detailed, there are specific steps I usually expect of teams in each of these phases. Whenever considering what to do next, first we do the clean-sheet design phase. In this phase, there are three key questions to ask:You ask them in this order, and put particular emphasis on these checks for agreement. Do these steps in writing, not just orally: it is far too easy, in my experience, for two people to talk about what they’re imagining and impose their imagination of what the other person is thinking on the conversation without making it explicit. Showing people the answer in a static form, where there’s no ambiguity about what’s being discussed, is irreplaceable.(The worst organizational mistakes I have ever seen made boil down to having done this wrong. In the better cases, teams have invested years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars in building a solution that nobody actually wanted; in the worse ones, people did actively destructive things because everyone had a sort of fuzzy agreement and nobody realized what was actually about to be done. If there is one thing you do to improve your process as an organization, it is to make sure that when you are trying to solve a problem, you always start with these three questions, always in writing, and always iterating until all parties agree on what’s being said here.)Once you have an answer to these three questions, and you know where you want to go, you move on to the planning phase. I’ll write in more depth about this stage another time, but the key idea is to separate this work into milestones.The defining feature of a good milestone is not intuitive: “launching a product” is not a good milestone. Instead, your goal is that each milestone capture real value. If you were to stop the entire project after achieving any milestone, you would feel that little if any time was wasted — the things you achieved at that milestone, whether they be a better understanding of the problem or a solution to some aspect of it, are valuable in and of themselves.Why? Because by the time you reach any particular milestone, the situation may have changed, priorities may have shifted, the entire problem may no longer be the thing you want to focus on. There are plenty of good reasons why the project might be wise to abandon. If each milestone marks the successful capture of value, though, this is not a waste.This possibility of abandonment brings us to the second rule of design, which again seems simple but actually goes against some very deep instincts.It is tempting, especially when we have spent years of effort, to fall in love with the systems we have built, and to feel defensive at any suggestion that they should be replaced. But this is a confusion of past and future: those systems were loved because they made things better, because they genuinely improved the world. If they have reached the point where they are ready to be replaced, it does not mean that they failed — far from it, it means that they have succeeded, they have finished their run, and it is time for them to receive an honorable retirement. Their successors are their intellectual children, created out of all of the things we learned from making them and using them; we want their successors to be better than they were, just as we want our own children to someday surpass us.It’s funny to think about, but one of the happiest days of my career so far has been when a system that I had built — a system that served 19 out of 20 of the documents that showed up in Google Search for over a decade — was retired. That system had done an amazing job; it was incredibly subtle to build and maintain, forced changes in our understanding of how search worked, drove all sorts of changes in both software and hardware architecture. And it was being replaced by a new system, built by the successor to the original team, which took everything we had learned from that decade, from that system and others, and built a new system which solved a new generation of problems in an even better way. That new system was damned beautiful. And I have no doubt that this system is even today approaching its own replacement, for the same reason. This day was not a funeral; it was a graduation, a moment of summation, to reflect on these accomplishments and look forward to the future.Because it had achieved its goal: how would we search an Internet that was a hundred times larger than “classical” search engines could handle? It had solved all the problems of its day, and the new system would solve the next generation of problems. The thing we had dedicated ourselves to was solving the problem of being able to find things and synthesize knowledge; the tool we built was a key step in solving that, but the problem continues.To be very honest, most problems continue, not just in engineering. Rabbi Tarfon used to say, “it is not yours to finish the work; but neither are you free to set it aside.” The problems most worth solving in life are often infinite in duration, and will not be solved during our lifetimes, nor in the lifetimes of our children. This means that what we can do is build steps towards their solution, to solve the aspects of them which surface in our time, and continue towards an ultimate goal that may (inshallah!) be achieved by our descendants.Arthur C. Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” There are many meanings to what he said, but I would like to draw your attention to its contrapositive:This line, sometimes referred to as Benford’s Law, at first seems like nothing more than a bon mot, a clever bit of wordplay telling us to “do better!” But it has a real meaning, which becomes clear when we ask ourselves what the word “magic” actually means in this context, and what it means to differ from that.While there are many definitions of the word, the key aspect of “magic” in this sentence is clearly not its supernatural origin — if anything, the whole point of Clarke’s statement was that “magic” can have a decidedly natural origin and still serve the same purposes. Instead, I would ask about what makes magic desirable in the first place: the ability to command the world, so to speak, to make it take the form you wish.This concept is actually embedded in the famous magic word “abracadabra,” which is not (contrary to popular belief) gibberish; it is Aramaic, meaning “let it come to pass as I have spoken.” The core aspect of magic, from this perspective, is that it can translate one’s inner vision of how the world ought to be directly into physical reality.This is the sense in which this statement is important. A technology becomes “distinguishable from magic” when one’s inner vision isn’t translated directly into reality, but requires laborious steps on the part of the user to convert. My visual imagination is considerably more vivid than my artistic talent, for example; I can imagine many images that I do not, even remotely, have the skill to put on paper. I could probably learn these skills, given a few decades of hard work, and then spend days or months or years creating a painting, but this is decidedly different from magic.For a technology to be truly “magical,” it needs to do a few things:The reason this gets a place in my three rules of design, although it is much narrower and more specific than the other two, is that it speaks to how we think about the problems we solve. Going back to the first rule, when we execute on its third step — describing the good solution — this rule becomes key to defining “good.” Even more importantly, it makes it much more possible to have the conversation with ones stakeholders to determine whether this actually solves their problem or not, because a system that requires much thinking and abstraction to use may or may not do the exact thing you are imagining, and during these conversations, both parties may not actually understand exactly what the system will be capable of if it does not have this property.The separation of the three properties of a magical design is also intentional. Describing, seeing, and manipulating are three distinct actions that need to share a language — and in terms of defining milestones, the ability to do any one of them to a problem is already a major advance. In my experience, a system which can simply describe existing reality in an easily comprehensible language is already a massive improvement to people’s lives, and if it then adds the ability to change that reality, so much the better.It is also very important to hew closely to the text of those properties. “See the current state,” for example, is not the same thing as “see the state that the system has been set to.” This was the lesson of Three Mile Island: the operators of the nuclear reactor had gauges which showed the current setting of the system, which were extremely useful until the day that a valve stuck and the system’s actual state became different from its set state. (For more details on this, see chapter 9 of Mahaffey’s Atomic Accidents, a detailed postmortem of every major nuclear accident since the discovery of the atom. My friend and colleague Lea Kissner has been recommending this book to young engineers for quite some time, and I heartily second it as a way to learn about how engineering can go wrong.)These three rules are individually simple, but actually executing on them carefully is much harder than it seems. The best explanation of this challenge is one I learned from another friend and colleague, Nelia Mann, who used to be a high-level competitive fencer. She explained to me that every fencing student goes through three stages in their career:The difference between the first stage and the third is the deep understanding of why the rules are there, and what it feels like when they are being done correctly or incorrectly. You learn that some rules are actually more like guidelines — things you normally do, but might diverge from in a range of cases, and you can explain why they do or don’t apply at any moment — while others are actually iron-clad rules, things you would never consider breaking in your line of work.My experience in the years since hearing this story is that these three stages are true not just of fencing, but of every skill. In software engineering, the skill I’ve been learning professionally for the past few decades, you see both this pattern and the non-obviousness of which is which: for example, the “rule” about partial ordering of mutexes is one which you occasionally do violate, although with extremely copious code comments to explain to future readers what is going on and why, but the rules about commenting your code, documenting ownership transfer of resources, or following code style guidelines turn into things you would no more think of violating than you would of typing all of your code backwards. The rules that seem to the beginner more basic and less obviously important actually turn out to be the most important to always follow perfectly.The three rules I’ve posited above, I list because they all fall into this second category: these aren’t rules that you follow approximately, but ones you spend time and effort perfecting your technique at, until they become second nature to you. The framing above is far from the first way I understood them; it itself is an output of spending years attempting to refine and improve my understanding of them, their meaning, and their application. I fully expect that these framings will continue to evolve and improve over time, and (in full accord with the second rule) that in time they may even be replaced by better ones.I look forward to that improvement, and hope that in the meantime, these rules prove useful to you.Yonatan Zunger is Distinguished Engineer at Twitter.

As a kid, after I learned to read to myself, I would close the door to my room, and lie on my side on the bed, elbow propping up my head, lost in a book for hours. Though reading was encouraged by my family, the extreme privacy of the reading experience felt somehow illicit. The books I read back then and the experience of reading them remain vivid. The River, The Trouble With Jenny’s Ear, A Secret Garden, Swallows and Amazons, A Wrinkle in Time, Melindy’s Medal, Gone With the Wind. These are some of the titles, in no particular order, that pop to mind for having absorbed me. I read to be immersed, to flee the stresses of school and the expectations of family, to carve out time for myself and my own thoughts. I particularly loved reading about girls. Girls who were brave or became brave. All girls — maybe all people — need models of bravery.When I became a writer, reading took on new purposes. I still read for entertainment and escape, but other reasons for reading entered too. I read to see how other writers employ certain techniques of craft. I read to stay on top of books the literary community was talking about. I read the books my book group was reading, and when I began teaching, I read the books I’d decided to teach. I sometimes found myself reading books I wasn’t fond of, but I finished them anyway. Sometimes reading felt like an obligation more than a pleasure, and I almost always felt I couldn’t stay on top of the reading I should be doing. I often yearned for the immersive, devil-may-care reading I’d done as a child, something which had begun to feel more elusive.When the pandemic hit, many people I knew, as well as people in the media, spoke about how their reading habits changed. Some said they couldn’t concentrate on reading at all. Others were reading a lot but different content, lighter fare perhaps. Still others talked of taking on reading projects, such as reading all of Tolstoy or Proust. My reading habits remained more or less the same. I still felt guilty about not reading enough (admiring all the reviewers and librarians I know who devour a book a day), and bad about not having read certain books everyone was talking about. I still felt like a student struggling to keep up with her assignments. How could I call myself a writer if I hadn’t read everything?Then, a year into the pandemic, I was diagnosed with ALS. Suddenly, tiring more easily and knowing my time on Earth was limited, every expenditure of time came under scrutiny. The pandemic restricted socializing, but I became even more rigorous about limiting social time. Talking took a lot of effort, and when I lost my voice entirely and began typing my conversation on a text-to-voice computer, that took even more effort. I prioritized the solitary activities of writing and reading (as I’ve always done).But what does a “dying person” read? It quickly became apparent to me that I could let go of the idea that I should read anything. Will I be refused admission to heaven — if such a place exists — because I haven’t read War and Peace? There are so many works of the old and new canons I wish I had read. So much poetry I wish I was familiar with. So many engaging works of nonfiction I know I would love. Let that go, Cai. Another long-time habit of mine has been intensified by my diagnosis: the habit of dipping into many books at a time, shuttling from one to another and reading short sections, either looking for traction or simply content to savor a small bit. If I’m not engaged by a book after reading fifty pages or so, I feel no compunction about setting it aside. (My first editor once said to me: I never read past an ugly first sentence. That was a comment that certainly gave me pause!) Beside my bed — which has become my office that my husband and I refer to as my “cockpit” — there is a growing stack of books, spine out, which I’ve read some of and set aside for one reason or another. I’m waiting for the summons to finish them. I was pleased to read in a recent New York Times interview with the author Yiyun Li that she, too, often shuttles from book to book.It’s hard to analyze exactly why a certain book electrifies me and another one leaves me cold. I have stopped caring about why my tastes don’t always align with the world at large, or even with my friends or former book group. The entire publishing industry is mystified about what grabs a reader, and clearly it is idiosyncratic, different for everyone. A chemistry as mysterious as falling in love. As a writer I understand that and do not expect everyone to respond to my work.I’m choosing books more carefully now. Not the books that the publicity machine is pushing on us all, but books from writers who seem wise, empathetic, humble; not simply lovers of words (though deploying words beautifully is also important in my choices). I am quite certain that the books I love are written by people I would also love. And I’ve had this borne out in quite a few instances when I’ve had the occasion to meet writers I’ve read. Alice McDermott, who I studied with at Sewanee Writers Conference, is truly an old soul, a wise and empathetic human being whose short novels are elegiac and transporting. She was exactly the same way as a workshop leader, calm and clear and friendly and soulful. Elizabeth Strout who I chatted with after one of the Portland Literary Arts Lecture, is similarly down-to-earth and humble, also radiating a soulful quality. These are women whose fiction has engaged and even transported me, and having met them, I understand why.Memoirs are of more interest to me these days, as they are a way to “meet” the author via the page, sinking me directly into another person’s way of thinking unmediated by fictional invention. Many people have given me, or recommended, memoirs about navigating disease and death, and while some of these books have engaged me, I have also developed some wariness. I began reading a book I’ve been meaning to read for a long time, On Being Mortal by Atul Gawande. A third of the way through the reading, I misplaced the book. By the time it reappeared in my husband’s bag — he had volunteered to carry it for me — I couldn’t reengage with it. It joined the pile beside my bed. Several ALS memoirs have come into my hands. With some of them, written by non-writers, I could not get past the first couple of pages (sorry to be a snob!). One turned out to be reasonably well-written, and it engaged me for a while, but I have stalled with that one too. I think I’m resistant to absorbing another person’s narrative of dying while I am trying to comprehend my own experience. I had a completely different experience with the beautiful memoir, When Breath Becomes Air, written by the rising-star physician Paul Kalanithi who documented his journey to death from cancer. I read that at a time in my life when death was theoretical, an experience I felt was far in the future.One of my two big-hearted sisters gave me a book called Walking Each Other Home, by Ram Das and Mirabai Bush. The book is written as a conversation between the two authors, and it lends itself to being read a few pages at a time. I am relishing it, as my sister said was her experience. It has made me realize that because I can’t converse (without technology) I want my reading experiences to feel like conversation, that I’m getting to know someone on the page who feels like a friend. Maybe this is what I’ve always sought in a book, the feeling that a writer’s words are catalyzing new thoughts in me that entwine with the writer’s thoughts in the dance of reading. A silent call-and-response.Poetry has summoned me too. Its intimacy seems to demand this call-and-response style of reading. I’m reaching into my bookshelves for the work I’ve always loved, and asking my niece, a poet, to recommend some of the poets she loves whose work I haven’t read. I read slowly, savoring the words, taking in a few lines, then pausing to think of their meaning, or multiple meanings, like the religious practice of Lectio Divina, without feeling a story’s propulsive pull urging me to find out what happens next. Anticipating a day when my hands will be too weak to hold a book or turn its pages, I look forward to listening to poetry read by actors with sonorous voices. Or my niece reading her poetry to me.So, I’m reading less, but I’m finding more satisfaction in what I read. I wish I had had this approach to reading earlier in my life. Letting go of those dictatorial shoulds. Reading as a way of listening to the voice of another human being behind the words, so it feels as if I’m in the presence of that other person, speaking — or perhaps dancing — with them.'], ['Cliffs Notes On Crack', 'Benjamin Keep, Ph.D.', 'Sep 14', 'https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/cliffs-notes-on-crack-120e4165b1ac?source=home---------285------------------0----------', 'About two years ago, someone contacted me to help them build a platform for summarizing books.

Yet what I have discovered is that instead of venturing outside of my field I’ve actually come to better understand the emotional and psychological forces that drive international relations. How insecurity in the home mirrors insecurity within and between states.Central to disputes within the family court is the idea of “natural authority”. Many men will unashamedly — or by subterfuge — claim that they have the right to dominate and abuse their family members. They believe their authority is a predetermined social structure that requires respect and submission. Far too often the court is sympathetic to this idea.International relations is also built around this idea of natural authority. Great powers are perceived to have the right to manage and manipulate their “sphere of influence”, and, like abusive fathers, their power is deemed to be an entitlement, not a responsibility.We are currently witnessing a brutal example of the natural authority that Russian president Vladimir Putin believes he has over Ukraine. For Putin, Russia’s dignity is tied to its ability to control the behaviour of Ukraine, as well as many other surrounding states. These states are given no agency of their own, like children forced into contact with fathers they are frightened of.One of the central insights we have to come to understand how violent men try to defend their authority is that of DARVO — Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. This is an observation of abusive men with narcissistic personality disorders developed by Dr Jennifer Freyd, Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon.The concept highlights how often perpetrators of violence not only deny their actions, but launch counter-offensives, attacking the credibility of anyone who provides evidence against them, while also claiming that the victim of abuse — or those reporting it in the case of child abuse — is actually the real perpetrator, and the accused is the real victim. This tactic has proved surprisingly effective in family courts.This victimhood is based on the instinctive belief that any attempt to constrain men’s perceived natural authority is a form of persecution. In its most extreme forms many men believe that they have the right to violence. An assertion that violence is a critical component of masculinity, and to deny men this right — or punish them for it — is to strip masculinity of its essence. This is why many men defensively assert that feminism is “anti-men.”One can easily see how this behaviour is mirrored by authoritarian states that seek to exert control over their own self-declared natural domains. DARVO is a form of disinformation and propaganda, designed not only to create confusion, to gaslight, and intimidate, but to establish a new narrative. To make people believe that what is obvious is actually fake — that murkier forces are at play, like Putin’s absurd claim that drug-addled Nazis are ruling Ukraine. The goal is to ferment a perpetual cynicism, to create a space where the truth has no power.Russia’s initial response to the reporting of its massing of troops on Ukraine’s border was to mock the West as hysterical and crazy — a tactic that victims of male violence will be familiar with. Despite its clear display of military aggression, Russia claimed that it was actually the real victim. That the West had been encroaching into Russia’s sphere of influence, that it was doing so out of jealousy at Russia’s unity and strength, and was driven by a hostile “anti-Russia” sentiment.That Russia subsequently invaded Ukraine, to Moscow, was irrelevant. As establishing the truth was not the point of Russia’s denial of its own actions. Saying one thing today and doing the opposite tomorrow is not a failing for states like Russia. It is how they exert dominance. Real power is the ability to enforce irrationality. If one can transcend not just basic human ethics, but also not be bound by the truth, then this is the true demonstration of one’s might.What often binds the home and international relations is a fascination with — and veneration of — the idea of might. We still find ourselves bound to a traditional archetype of what a man should be; a towering figure, manifesting physical strength, power and control. This leads many men to seek to personify these traits in their relationships, while for societies at large we fantasise about great men engaged in great power politics. We see men like Putin as having immense virility and cunning, playing a game of 3D chess that lesser men (and of course women) could never fathom.Yet rather than a strategic genius, Putin instead seems to be consumed by an emotional maelstrom. Making decisions that are informed by grievance, obsession, and narcissism. He is a chaotic actor, struggling to come to terms with his own psychological impulses. While, horribly for the people of Ukraine, using one of the world’s most powerful militaries to demonstrate these inadequacies.Putin’s chaos is not incompatible with his desire for dominance. Often chaos is dominance’s primary tool; a way to confuse and demoralise a target. Yet dominance and control are also not the same thing. The impulse to exert dominance is often driven by a lack of control. The most dangerous time for women in abusive relationships is when they try to leave. With the abuse often escalating to murder. Putin’s brutal reaction to Ukraine’s desire for self-determination is clearly driven by the same violent resentment.We are currently in an era of heightened male emotion. It is the thread that connects almost all of the world’s current destabilising forces. There are, of course, a great diversity of factors that are driving these emotive and often destructive responses. But as men, there is a pressing need for us to confront certain aspects of masculinity that are antithetical to peace — the lust for power and control, the instinct to see aggression as a positive, and the impulse to use intimidation as a tool to advance our interests.Realists will claim that this is simply the nature of men and therefore it is the nature of states. But states are not bound to behave in preconceived ways regardless of who governs them. We are capable of infusing them with new values, and new modes of operation. An emerging idea like Feminist Foreign Policy is designed to reshape the way we think about power, how we understand the roots of violence, and how we seek to mitigate it. And crucially, who we choose to make our decisions.Central to Feminist Foreign Policy is the recognition that it is not just national or international instability that threatens individual security, but that insecurity also flows in the other direction. That there are concentric circles of violence that compound and ripple up from the individual and household to the state and international level. We cannot solve war without solving domestic violence; the world’s primary security problem.Rather than confront these domestic horrors, the family court finds itself trapped by the need to coddle the egos of abusive men, for fear of what they may do otherwise. Here in Australia, the spectre of Leonard Warwick — the family court bomber — haunts the institution. For many of those who seek to blame Russia’s aggression on eastern European states’ desire to join NATO it is the same calculation — that we need to placate Putin so he doesn’t become worse. The title of Australian journalist Jess Hill’s book on domestic abuse “See What You Made Me Do” comes to mind.What the current crisis in Ukraine should inspire is a reckoning with machismo. An understanding that our conceptions of masculinity, what we expect men to be, and what behaviours we tolerate from them, are central to our stability. As men, we need to comprehend that the seeds of authoritarianism, war and chaos, lie in our individual relations with those around us.The courage currently on display by Ukrainians is not bravado. It is instead strength of character — the ability to orientate and commit oneself to a moral imperative. Strength is not the ability to intimidate, coerce and harm. Societies that submit themselves to this behaviour, or be attracted to these kinds of traits as individuals or in leaders, will only ever repeat the brutal failures that stem from them.'], ['There is More than Meets the Eye in Patagonia’s Bold Activism', 'Joseph Dana', 'Sep 27', 'https://josephdana.medium.com/there-is-more-than-meets-the-eye-in-patagonias-bold-activism-4d4170953ba?source=home---------217------------------0----------', 'Few other companies have been so closely associated with environmental causes than Patagonia.

Because I think it is an important topic for strategy, I decided to dedicate my 46th Year II Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Quiet Quitting & Strategy: The Humanity Imperative. You can find the previous 98 PTW/PI here.The PhenomenonQuiet Quitting has come to define the concept of ceasing to commit meaningfully to one’s job and just doing enough to meet the definitions in one’s job description, essentially a form of ‘work to rule.’ The general view is that it has become a more prevalent phenomenon of late — increasing in frequency.It is interesting to note the alliterative name of this phenomenon. Research shows that alliteration improves processing fluency for our brains, which results in a term featuring alliteration being perceived as truer than one without — see this for a nice overview of the processing fluency field. I believe that Quiet Quitting has become an important concept in the mind of the public because the processing fluency of its awesome new name has resulted in it being perceived as ‘the truth.’However, the phenomenon isn’t at all new: it has been around for quite some time. Gallup has been measuring employee engagement since 2000. Its survey places workers in one of three categories: engaged, meaning that the workers are “involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace;” non-engaged, workers who put time but not energy or passion into their work; or disengaged, workers are mentally checked out and have little if any concern for the performance of their company, which sounds remarkably like Quiet Quitters.As of early 2022, only one third (32%) of US employees were in the engaged category, another half (51%) were non-engaged, and the final sixth (17%) are disengaged, Quiet Quitters — tens of millions of them. Of course, these numbers are dreadful — remarkably low engagement — and while the numbers are trending in a slightly negative direction, they have been consistently awful since Gallup started measuring them in 2000.The other related ‘new phenomenon,’ is what has become known as The Great Resignation (which doesn’t sound as cool as Quiet Quitting does it?). Characterized by the media as a post-COVID phenomenon, a record 48 million American workers resigned from their jobs in 2021. But it really isn’t. For over a decade, the resignation rate has increased at almost exactly the same rate every year.Net, Quiet Quitting isn’t anything new. But it is part of a debilitating phenomenon for business. How can you run a business with one sixth of your workforce completely disengaged and half of them not engaged? It is too much for the fully engaged third of your workforce to carry the entire burden.How Did We Get to this Place?It feels hard to imagine how we got to this dreadful place of overwhelming worker disengagement. A big piece of the problem is that business didn’t pay enough attention Peter Drucker and let the humanity of work decline at a time Drucker argued that it needed to increase.Drucker sounded the first alarm on this front in 1959 when he coined the term “knowledge work.” He argued that when we ask workers to use the muscle between their ears more so than the muscles in their arms, legs, or back, workers will scrutinize the nature of their jobs more rigorously. They can’t dissociate themselves from the work of their brain to nearly the extent they can with physical work. With physical work, they do the work. With knowledge work, they are the work.As was so often the case, Drucker was uncanny in his ability to foresee the future and knowledge work grew dramatically in the subsequent decades. He returned to the subject in 1992 when he argued that knowledge workers need to be treated as you would a volunteer. Since volunteers are unpaid, they will only volunteer their time for your cause if they believe in and are motivated by the purpose of the organization. He warned against the assumption that you could attract, maintain, and motivate paid employees by compensating them monetarily to a sufficiently high extent.Drucker lived to see the huge increase in the knowledge work that he foresaw and in the time since his passing it has become harder and harder to identify jobs that don’t involve substantial knowledge work. Factory workers engage in Lean and Kaizen. Retail workers need to interface substantially with information technology. Wait staff take orders on iPads. Obviously, there is a range of knowledge intensity across the wide spectrum of American jobs, but for most workers of today, they are centrally employing their brain in acquitting their job and therefore companies should expect them to hold their work to a higher standard.I have always felt that Drucker held a holistic view of the humanity of workers. A worker couldn’t be simplistically viewed as a tool or as a party to a financial contract. To him, they were humans with a range of needs that required holistic understanding and treatment.And I think that business has largely failed on this front — and has a disengagement crisis to show for it.On this subject, my mind goes over two decades back to a tour that I was given of a tech giant’s newly renovated workspace. It had completely overhauled a huge old manufacturing facility for use as a software development lab. They were proud of the facility because the architects had designed a classic main street down the center of the facility, with old-fashioned streetlights, a coffee shop, ice cream parlor, hairdresser, bank, newsstand, pharmacy, laundry and more. It was beautiful — right out of a Norman Rockwell painting.I asked to see the rest of the facility — and it was rows upon rows of cubicles where the engineers would spend their days when not walking the main street. They were really nice cubicles — the newest designs, but they were cubicles, cubicles and more cubicles. All cubicles are descended from Herman Miller’s Action Office II (as with Apple I and II, the first version had minor impact on the world while the second was transformational) launched in 1968. While designer Robert Propst had lofty ideals about how it would elevate the work experience of users, corporate purchasers quickly seized on it as a means to dense-pack employees in the most cost-efficient manner and became the butt of Dilbert cartoons.My reaction to the visit — a disappointment to the host because I didn’t leave with the desired level of enthusiasm — was that the main street made the overall work experience worse by accentuating the contrast between the fabulous attention to humanity on main street side-by-side with complete inattention in the cubicles.In the decades since, I have seen this inattention to a holistic view of humanity play out again and again. Companies seem to believe that they can place two fundamentally conflicting aspects of the worker’s experience side-by-side, yet workers will think it is just fine. They don’t. Modern workers need to see and feel a consistent humanity in their job. Otherwise, they will disengage. Metaphorically, they can’t have main street and cubicles side-by-side in the construction of their jobs.I see a consistent set of features of companies that undermine the humanity of worker experience and in doing do cause workers to feel less connected to and more disengaged from their company. For example…Abstract PurposeDrucker was correct: workers need to feel motivated and compelled by the purpose of the organization to which they are dedicating their worklife. They aren’t motivated by a highly abstract concept like shareholder value maximization. They don’t spend their working lives happily toiling for nameless, faceless people called shareholders. For most shareholders, the name on the stock register isn’t actually the name of the shareholder but rather of a fiduciary (e.g., Fidelity, Black Rock) acting on behalf of the real and hidden shareholder. Not only that, those nameless, faceless shareholders come and go as they please, selling their shares without giving a rationale or notice.That is not how genuine human relationships work. They aren’t anonymous and fleeting. Workers may care about each other and customers but if the stated purpose of the company is put shareholders first and foremost, the workers will not feel a consistent sense of humanity. It will feel fractured — part imbued with humanity, part artificial and abstract — a recipe for disengagement.Simpleminded MotivationMost companies utilize monetary incentive compensation to motivate employees to do their job. For example, if they meet their budget/target, they receive a 15% bonus. That is not how authentic human relationships work. Your marital partner or best friend doesn’t dole out extra cash for fulfilling your relationship promises. If you fulfill your promises, you will strengthen the relationship going forward and enjoy the attendant benefits. If you don’t, you will weaken it and, in due course, the relationship will end.If you seek to motivate behavior with monetary incentive compensation, you will be attempting, per Drucker, to appeal to workers’ greed not to their sense of purpose. That won’t feel authentically human to workers.Unfair Distribution of BenefitsCompanies pay different wages for identical work and think those being paid less — especially women and minorities — will ‘understand.’ Centibillionaire owners think it will work out just fine to pay their workers less than a living wage. But the distaste for unfairness runs deep. This is even the case with monkeys as demonstrated in the famous experiment with capuchin monkeys. When one monkey is rewarded with a cucumber slice and the second with a much-preferred grape, the first monkey throws the cucumber slice at the researcher in anger. What was previously a delicious slice of cucumber transforms into a slap in the face.The purpose may be appealing and the work inherently rewarding, but fundamental unfairness in the distribution of benefits of the work won’t feel human and will be unsustainable. If this was a company with a business model that necessitated the first monkey to performing the task at lower reward, the company would eventually collapse in the face of unfairness.Practitioner InsightsThese are but a few examples of the failure of companies to create an experience that is holistically human for workers. To me, this inattention to humanity is the most important driver of the Gallup disengagement numbers, the Great Resignation, and Quiet Quitting. The implication for your strategy is that it must incorporate and reflect a holistic conception of humanity. The company needs to feel holistically human — not feature dissonance between human and artificial attributes.It starts with having a strategy, the Winning Aspiration of which is attractive to the workers that you need to fulfill the strategy. Like everything in strategy, it is a choice. Your higher-order aspiration won’t be attractive to all potential workers. But it needs to be an environment in which the right workers for your strategy feel they can authentically embrace.Then, make sure that shareholder value is not the overarching goal but rather simply an output of achieving the aspiration of your strategy, which is the case for many private, family-owned companies. Don’t rely on monetary incentive compensation for motivation. Pay well and make continued upward progress in the organization the biggest reward for performance excellence. And work extra hard to structure fairly the benefits of the joint application of capital and work. That is hard to accomplish consistently but important to create a work environment that features uniform and unfailing humanity.'], ['Why Everything Looks the Same', 'Ryan Duffy', 'Oct 23', 'https://medium.com/knowable/why-everything-looks-the-same-bad80133dd6e?source=home---------105------------------0----------', 'Do you ever get the feeling that everything around you looks the same?Across every consumer category, variety and originality have given way to monotony and conformity.A triple threat of economic globalization, generational transition, and new technology has flattened the aesthetics of our digital and physical lives.What are the origins of these regressive trends? Why do they matter? And what can founders, marketers, and creators do to stand out amid a sea of sameness?In his 2016 story for The Verge titled “Welcome to Airspace: How Silicon Valley helps spread the same sterile aesthetic across the world,” Kyle Chayka revealed the banal consequences of Airbnb’s rapid rise. Playing on the company’s name, he called the phenomenon AirSpace:The 2007 introduction of the iPhone opened the door to the social web, transforming our digital lives. By the time Chayka wrote his story in 2016, those technologies were reshaping our physical spaces, too — at global scale.When Airbnb launched in 2008, it sold itself as a new way to travel, allowing users to experience cities how locals do. It was about human connection and authenticity. But it wasn’t long before a creeping sameness set in:From Brooklyn to Mexico City to Tokyo, interior spaces became interchangeable. As Chakya wrote:Ironically, Airbnb’s original promise of a differentiated travel experience was neutered by the defining qualities of the hotel industry it aimed to disrupt:The social web smoothed the rough edges of taste, substituting idiosyncratic local charm for blank placelessness — a bellwether for a broader trend to come.Chayka’s articulation of AirSpace was prescient, but the term never quite caught on.A different one did: Blanding.Blanding is the copy-paste model of consumer product development and brand marketing that follows repetitive patterns in the name of modernity but at the expense of authenticity and originality.The last decade saw an explosion of new direct-to-consumer brands gain mindshare and wallet share, especially among the millennial set. Think Casper mattresses, Away luggage, and Warby Parker eyewear.Fueled by the internet’s democratization of ad targeting, a newly-employed generation of young people with disposable income, and a steady flow of venture capital investment, a class of insurgent startups barged its way into markets previously dominated by a small group of legacy corporations.But their disruption quickly gave way to the sanitized agreeableness of blanding.As Ben Schott wrote in Bloomberg Opinion:Chasing the same valuable millennial demo, many direct-to-consumer brands followed a turnkey pattern:They abided by the same aesthetic conventions:Even their names were paint-by-numbers:These prefabricated brand signifiers combined to give us what we now know as the “millennial aesthetic,” a blueprint designed to entice Instagram-obsessed young people.Alas, the millennial aesthetic that defined the past decade is showing its age. Some are even declaring it officially “over.” Or worse: cheugy.But blanding isn’t dead. It’s just evolving. And Gen Z is setting the template for blanding 2.0, an explicit rejection of the previous generation’s conventions but familiar nonetheless.The more things change, the more they stay the same.The scourge of blanding isn’t limited to Airbnbs and direct-to-consumer products. You can find examples across every consumer category.Seemingly all at once, the world’s biggest luxury fashion brands replaced their charmingly unique logos with nearly identical semi-bold, sans-serif, all-caps wordmarks. Squint, and you can hardly tell the difference.A 2021 Road & Track article titled “Why does every new car look like every other new car?” compares the form factors of midsize SUVs from 24 manufacturers. Despite a wide range of price points, they’re more alike than they are different:Website design, especially for SaaS companies, is depressingly mundane:Or just take a look at the landing pages of these four subscription media products — slightly different conventions than SaaS products but indistinguishable nonetheless.This suppression of creativity in web design has even been confirmed by science.When you’re endlessly scrolling DoorDash or UberEats, do you ever get a feeling of déjà vu?On-demand food delivery has given rise to ghost kitchens and virtual restaurants. Digital-native restaurateurs can now use the same chefs, facilities, ingredients, and packaging to fulfill orders for multiple “restaurants” simultaneously. So whether tonight’s dinner comes from Wings and Things, Wings Plus, or Hot Wings Cafe, you’re getting the same food, in the same container, from the same kitchen.In 2013, Netflix’s Ted Sarandos famously told GQ:“The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.”When it launched its streaming service, Netflix offered two key value propositions that differentiated it from every other market player:Its aversion to ads was baked into the culture from square one. As CEO Reed Hastings said in a 2019 earnings call:Never say never.Facing increased competition from new streaming players like HBOMax, Netflix is abandoning its two core tenets by introducing an ad-supported tier and reportedly considering a traditional weekly release schedule for some of its shows.So, yes, Netflix is becoming like HBO — just not in the ways Sarandos probably imagined back in 2013.The world’s biggest social media apps are becoming more alike than different — often by brazenly copying the competition’s features. Meta’s Instagram is the prime culprit:But Meta isn’t the only guilty party:These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. The lines between social apps will continue to blur long into the future.Blanding has infected nearly every aspect of the modern consumer experience. And it’s not by chance that its rise parallels social media’s.Algorithms haven’t just reshaped the way we consume content. They’ve insidiously retrained us to want the same things, flattening taste and desire like pancakes. As Chayka wrote:It’s also no coincidence that the “disruptive” companies most responsible for the creep of global monotony are funded by a relatively small cohort of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. VCs are known for “pattern matching,” a method of reasoning by analogy when evaluating early-stage companies for investment. With few measurable criteria upon which to judge a startup, they instead look for familiar patterns from the market or their own experiences as indicators of potential success. Unfortunately, this methodology results in an extreme lack of diversity across the industry. Venture-backed founders are disproportionately similar demographically:When the capital that drives innovation comes from and goes to a homogenous population with a relatively narrow shared worldview, it should come as no surprise that its outputs are so alike.There are functional, industry-specific factors that impose uniformity, too:Two recent products demonstrate the competitive advantage of resistance to blanding.Until recently, the grocery store bottled water aisle was dominated by indistinguishable brands. Clear plastic bottles, soft blues, and images of mountains and streams as far as the eye could see.Enter Liquid Death: a brand that zigs hard against the category’s tired zags. Death metal-inspired graphic design. Hyper-aggressive copywriting. And aluminum tallboy packaging that begs for a brown paper bag.It’s undeniably and unapologetically different. It’s also one of the fastest-growing non-alcoholic beverage brands in recent history, achieving a $700m valuation in less than five years.Although it doesn’t go into production until 2023, the Tesla Cybertruck is one of the most talked-about vehicles in the world today. That’s thanks to a form factor unlike anything the market has ever seen. Its designers abandoned every conceivable convention to build something entirely new. Halo’s Master Chief would be proud.Time will tell if the final product lives up to the hype, but with more than one million units reportedly pre-ordered (5x more than Tesla’s Model 3), it’s already a serious contender.Of course, there’s a business case for following proven formulas:These are conventional wisdoms, not universal truths.And some rules are made to be broken.Real-time paradigm shifts like no-code, cloud computing, drop shipping, AI, and remote work are democratizing entrepreneurship in unprecedented ways.Long protected by gatekeepers, the means of production, promotion, and distribution are now freely available to anyone with a laptop.Today, one person with no business or product experience can do what would have taken a team of highly-trained people just a few years ago — in less time, for a fraction of the cost.That means more crowded markets, more intense competition, and more value placed on uniqueness, or what VCs call “alpha.” Adamant Ventures founder Jason Yeh defines alpha as:Submission to blanding’s gravitational pull signals to the market and investors that a business lacks the competitive edge needed to win.In business, it rarely makes sense to reinvent the wheel completely.But now more than ever, identifying your points of differentiation — your alpha — is critical.For more insights like these, get the Knowable app and join 40,000+ founders, creators, and everyday go-getters building new skills and fueling their ambitions with audio lessons on business, startups, self-improvement, and more from the world’s smartest people.

Entrenchment is the preferred strategy of incumbents. “Change is good” … unless you’re already killing it. In Google’s first decade, the company seized the search engine market, launched Maps, Mail, and Chrome. The company’s track record of abandoned projects ever since is so extensive, there’s a website dedicated to it. Stagnation? Maybe. But over that time, playing defense has earned $1.4 trillion in profit for Google’s shareholders.Meta has been playing defense since it dropped the “The,” and every failure has made the Zuck angrier. His accumulated rage has resulted in a $60 billion fit of “I’ll show you,” despite every signal that can hold light pointing to a cosmic failure. Like … a failure of the ages. A tech failure to end almost all failures. Bad. The … Metaverse.Tech companies aren’t the only ones that attempt to build moats at the cost of innovation. Politics rewards durability. Incumbents remain incumbents via a system that tilts toward the status quo. The U.S. House reelection rate in 2020 was 95%. The mortality rate for Americans the (average) age of our representatives is approximately 2%. Meaning, with a two year term, it will soon be a coin flip whether they were voted out or left the rotunda feet first. The result: A daily occupation of our nation’s capital (and our capital) by a group that is a cross between The Golden Girls and The Walking Dead. Our leaders are too old.There are real benefits to age, specifically experience and perspective. But that additional perspective and experience comes at a cost, as our representatives have a difficult time understanding new technologies and how society has changed. Folks who have ideas for change and the hunger to set them in motion are shut out, left with staff roles or positions in private enterprise.In business, entrenchment is profitable for shareholders, though eventually an innovator will rise. In politics, the biggest winner is often the politician — and when governments are dysfunctional or allocate scarce resources poorly, we all suffer. We need more churn.We should impose term limits on our elected officials and judges. The House and Senate have virtually become life-tenured positions, in which members accrue wealth via insider trading and devote their time in office to … their time in office. (Congresspeople trading stocks is blatant insider trading, full stop.)America is similar to most countries in that our legislators keep getting re-elected indefinitely. A key difference: Our Supreme Court justices can remain until death. This is rare. Most developed nations either have judicial age limits — the U.K., for example — or term limits. In Germany, justices on the Federal Constitutional Court are appointed for a single 12-year term.Term limits would improve the functioning of the Supreme Court and remove the toxic jockeying for seats we’ve seen in recent years. Give each of the nine justices a single 18-year term, staggered so an empty seat comes up in the first and third years of each presidential term. (Early departures would be filled through the end of the term to keep the schedule.) When life rarely exceeded 60, life tenure was a defense against politicization. With justices sitting for decades and into their 80s, life tenure makes it worse.Term limits are also effective in business. Companies with more outside directors who have extended tenure produce significantly fewer patents and these patents receive fewer citations. These businesses also register lower R&D productivity (i.e., they’re less innovative). Yet only 6% of the companies in the S&P 500 have formal tenure limits on directors. Entrenchment begets entrenchment — not a single S&P 500 board has fired its CEO since 2020. On every public board I’ve served on there are directors who’ve served the company well — and should have stepped down a decade ago.Term limits would go a long way toward reducing the instinct to entrenchment that’s endemic to our government. But we should recognize the need for another limit, one that reflects biology. Mandatory retirement ages. (Cue the “like your work, but was disappointed” comments on this post.)From AI and genomics to Auto-Tune and TikTok, the issues facing elected representatives are evolving … faster and faster. I try to stay up on everything happening in tech, and it’s getting harder as I get older. It’s true that age can bring wisdom. (It doesn’t always.) But wisdom can’t erase a biological truth we’re less comfortable with: Age makes us stupider.By the time we hit 40, our brains begin to deteriorate. Literally. The prefrontal cortex thins, the cerebellum shrinks, neurons become physically shorter, and arterial walls harden, decreasing blood flow. The decline is slow at first — we lose roughly 0.2% in brain volume per year. By 60, that number reaches 0.5%. Soon the rate of brain atrophy looks like Moore’s Law. We used to know this, but then decided that engaging in a discussion on the topic renders you an ageist. And being accused of an “ist” means you risk sanctioning, or worse. Ageism is not politically correct. But neither is biology.Ours is the oldest government in U.S. history. Almost a quarter of Congress is older than 70. If he’s re-elected — and lives out his term — President Biden will leave the West Lawn on Marine One for the last time at the age of 86. This is fucking ridiculous. BTW, an obese 82-year-old (Trump) wouldn’t be much better. The Senate Majority Leader is 71, the Senate Minority Leader is 80, and the Speaker of the House is 81. Two hundred years ago, the median age of a Congressperson was 44; today it’s 62. Put another way, the average representative is 24 years older than the average American (38). It’s true we live much longer today, but your modern brain doesn’t care that it’s less likely to die from sepsis or smallpox. When George Washington took office at 57, he was old for his time, but his brain was still just 57. Indeed, the founders had little need to include upper age limits in the Constitution — hardly anyone lived past 70.The situation is, again, unique. Our government is older than that of any other nation. In China, the average member of the National People’s Congress is 53. In the U.K. Parliament, it’s 51; in Germany’s Bundestag, 47.The notion of someone clinging to power for decades conjures a cartoon of a Third World dictator. However, it’s us. Specifically, the U.S. Congress. The news out of Iran this month is stirring, but the counterpoint to all these young people finding their voice is the 83-year-old Supreme Leader sending out thugs to beat them. Khamenei was 39, in his prime, during the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The women protesting in his streets today are much younger than that — many of their parents weren’t even born in 1979. Who has the more legitimate claim on the future of Iran? The young Iranians in the streets, or the octogenarian having them beaten? In the U.S., people under the age of 40 have seen their wealth, as evidenced by their share of GDP, cut in half. Why? Network effects? Globalization? No. Because their government does not represent them. The dysfunction of the governments in Iran and the U.S. has many factors, and one of them is that they simply won’t retire. We need to age-gate the most important elected offices.I’m not alone in calling for age limits. Former President Jimmy Carter expressed concern over the age of the 2020 presidential candidates, stating: “I hope there’s an age limit … If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president.” Who else agrees? Six in 10 Americans.Yes, it’s ageist, and so is biology. Science doesn’t care about our feelings. And yes, a bright-line rule would exclude some good candidates. We have a 79-year-old president who is registering one of the most productive terms in U.S. history. Also, we’ve seen the footage of our Speaker’s steady hand at 80 years old on January 6. But what you didn’t see in that video was the brilliant 56-year-old who didn’t have the experience but did have the perspective of someone who hasn’t spent 43% of her life in Washington. What else wasn’t shown in that video: a government more concerned with governing and less with re-election that may have averted this mess.It’s not just about cognitive decline. Ours is supposed to be a representative democracy, and the “representative” part matters. A politician of any creed, color, or gender can effectively represent a diverse community. But a government body, an assemblage of what should be our best and brightest, must represent our diverse experiences within a range, or it will not be regarded as credible, legitimate, or, most important, a body people want to join. Age is a component of this, an important one in our changing world. Fifty percent of the US population is under the age of 38. Among our elected representatives, that number is 5%.One of the most difficult conversations I’ve had with my dad was telling him he should stop driving. Telling the man who taught you how to drive that his neurocognitive architecture isn’t fit for a basic life function — and will never be again … that’s something nobody is ever ready to hear. But someone needed to tell him, because in his view, he was fine.Dynamic firms lose customers when they shed slow-growing products, fire employees who aren’t contributing, lose employees whose human capital could be more productive elsewhere, and change plans to evolve with the market. There is no growth without churn. Survival is the ultimate teacher, but its incorrect lesson, as we age, is: more of the same.A more physically and mentally robust leadership. A representative democracy that’s better able to shape policies that stanch the record transfer of wealth from young to old. New people, new ideas. Churn.Life is so rich,P.S.

I was a college student with no money for rent, food, bills, or anything really. I was waiting for the clock to turn midnight when the monthly student welfare would be paid to my bank account. When the day officially changed, I withdrew a couple hundred euros from an ATM. But it wasn’t for bills or food. That money was earmarked for gassing up the car and driving to another city in the middle of the night to buy a used graphics card. Getting that card ASAP was my top priority in life.F\\nast rewind a couple of weeks back, a friend of mine asked me if I had heard of something called Bitcoin. There was supposedly this Internet currency that had been rapidly gaining value, and anyone could mine it on their computer. Bitcoin was trading at about 15 euros a piece and it got me interested enough to read up on it and to figure out how mining works. To mine Bitcoin, you must harness your computer’s processing power in the quest of solving extremely complex mathematical problems.Other miners in the network are doing the same and the Bitcoin protocol automatically rewards the first one to get to the correct answer with Bitcoins. Due to the difficulty of the calculations, every miner in the network is essentially trying to guess the answer. The more guesses your machine can do per second, the more likely you’ll get it right. As more miners join the network, the problems get more difficult and earning coins slows down. Here’s a more in-depth explanation of the process.After some rough calculations, my computer’s hashing power would have yielded only 0.05 Bitcoins (0.75€) per day, which would not be worthwhile considering the cost of electricity. But there was another cryptocurrency, Litecoin that stole our attention. It was marketed as the “silver for Bitcoin’s gold” with faster transaction times, cheaper price and much faster mining due to it’s lower popularity. There were Cryptocurrency exchanges online enabling you to trade Litecoins for Bitcoins, euros and dollars. Mining Litecoins was far more profitable and my computer was able to eke out almost two Litecoins (5€) in a day. I started thinking about ways to scale the operation up as much as possible!The main component used in mining was the computer graphics card. Motherboards, processors and RAM memory did not play an important role at all. As long as your hardware had a PCI-E slot for a graphics card and a power supply capable of running it at full power, you could efficiently mine cryptocurrencies. I used to buy and sell a lot of computer hardware, so I had extra motherboards and other components lying around, but only a few graphics cards.I whipped up an improvised secondary computer from spare parts and took it as a test to my friend’s student dormitory where the electricity was “free”. Upon returning home, I rounded up all my computer parts and concluded that I could immediately run a total of five graphics cards spread across three computers at home. I just needed more cards, but there was an issue: I was completely broke, with overdue bills and the rent a few weeks late.I\\nwas living on student welfare, totalling to about 500 euros per month. I also owned a car which was a luxury I really couldn’t afford. At the end of the month I was always scrambling for money, late on my bills and hoping I could find a way out of it. Mining cryptocurrencies seemed like a real opportunity to finally “make it”. I firmly decided to spend all of my money not on the rent, nor on my overdue bills, but on more graphics cards from nearby online sellers. I now had a total of three cards mining Litecoins day in, day out, yielding about 12€ of profit per day. The income already almost equaled my student welfare and I had no intention to stop expanding!Next up, my eyes were firmly set on a very specific date: March 4th, 2013. At midnight that day, I would receive my next student welfare payment. I had arranged the pickup for a new card for that night at 1:00 AM, just an hour after the money would land on my account. With my car running on fumes, I drove to a gas station, pulled the money out of an ATM and gassed up my trusty steed for the nightly drive. One more card, check!I spent the rest of the money next day to buy that fifth card with a cash deal in the city center. I tried to set aside some money for food and bills, but knew very well it wasn’t going to get me even through the rest of the week. Having food to eat was a minuscule goal compared to maxing out my mining specs.Mining cryptocurrencies requires a lot of power, which equates to a lot of heat. Running my miners at full power caused extreme overheating and I didn’t want to limit their speed. I did what any crypto-crazy miner would have done: I stripped out all the components from the miner cases and laid them on a table, bare, with all wires connected. I shoved the table against my kitchen ventilation window so the components could bask in the chilly air flowing inside.It looked like a true fire hazard with no cases, cables hanging everywhere and everything exposed. Instead of being able to press the power button of a computer case, I was now turning the computers on and resetting them by short-circuiting the motherboard pins with a screwdriver. But man did they run cool. Even at peak power, the card temperatures were far below the max, making them work for prolonged periods without crashing.By\\nnow I was making a profit of about 20 euros per day. To expand, I would have to acquire even more base components and graphics cards. I sold all my valuable belongings and the mined coins as soon as they were coming in. With these and the help of buy now, pay later services, I was able to buy new top-end motherboards, second hand graphics cards to fill them up and the hefty power supplies required to run them. I was also able to rack up a pretty admirable debt in the process!I crammed yet another miner on the kitchen table, one next to the backyard door and a third one in the middle of my living room floor. No cases, propped up on cardboard boxes and operated via my trusty screwdriver. There were a total of 14 graphics cards mining coins, yielding about 55 euros of profits every single day. The cash flow was hard to argue against so I kept reinvesting everything on mining.I upgraded all my cards to the newest HD7900 series, which brought about a 50% boost in hashing power. I then populated even my bedroom with a mining rig, shooting up my profits to 80 euros per day! I had installed TeamViewer on my smartphone to fine tune my miners, even when I wasn’t home. It felt like doing an on-call shift 24/7 with multiple incidents occurring every single day, just to maximize my profits.Upgrading the cards had raised my farm’s total power consumption to over 5 kilowatts. I had already distributed the miners to multiple areas in the apartment before to avoid blowing individual easy-to-replace fuses, but now it didn’t matter where the miners were located anymore. Mining at full power and flipping on the stove or going to the sauna could have blown the main fuse of the apartment. I couldn’t add a single card more.It\\nwas July 2013 and the warmest month of the year in Finland. Ambient temperatures in my crib eventually crept up to a shocking 43 degrees celsius (109°F) during daytime. I didn’t have to worry about going to the sauna anymore, I was living in one.The combined noise of all the cards’ fans spinning at 100% was deafening and resembled the sound of operating a vacuum cleaner, times three. I asked my neighbors if they had heard any noise, just to be sure I wouldn’t bother them. I myself was already numb to it.To optimize my miners, I started running them slower during the day and cranked em’ up at night. I now kept switching between different cryptocurrencies, depending on which one was the most profitable to mine at any given moment. I may have woken up mining Litecoin and switched to Worldcoin or Feathercoin by lunch. It was the only way to maintain high profitability. I even set up an alarm system for any price changes and it sure kept me on the edge day and night.W\\nhen the summer was nearing its end, the weather cooled down and the living conditions in my apartment became humane again. I was able to run my miners at acceptable speeds again, especially at night.The influx of new people entering the crypto mining game during the summer had dropped my daily mining profits to 30–40€ per day. Meanwhile, my monthly electricity bill was hovering somewhere around a thousand euros. I was barely breaking even, but I kept on going, hoping to mine the right coin at the right time.Once winter officially arrived, I cranked up my miners to full speed. Even so, the ambient temperature in my apartment was only 10 degrees celsius (50°F) with all doors and windows open. I was dressed in full winter clothing to fight the cold and wore shoes because the floor was close to freezing temperature.I slept my nights on the living room couch with the aforementioned alarms blaring in case a miner had crashed or if I had to switch the mined coin. I was enjoying some of my greatest profits so far, gaining a good 100 euros per day on average, but I was also battling a new foe: snow.Yes, the spring, summer and autumn rains were a blessing when it came to temperatures, but snow is floaty. Snowflakes of all sizes would fly in through the doors and windows and land on my mining clusters. Snow and electricity don’t mix well, so I devised various types of plastic and cardboard shelters, under which the miners could hide. But it wasn’t enough.I woke up to a crashed miner alert. It had been snowing heavily and the snow had landed on the miner shelter next to the backyard door. The melted snow accumulated into enough water to drip through the cover and crash the miner. I dried up the components and used my screwdriver to short-circuit the start button pins; maybe it could still work?My action was immediately met by a negating flash of fire originating from the miner’s 700 euro Radeon HD7990 dual GPU graphics card. It seemed as if someone had lit a big fat match inside of my crown jewel card, rendering it into trash metal. It cost me a big bunch of my profits, but times were good so I was able to recoup the losses in no time.E\\nven though mining was extremely profitable, there were new FPGA and ASIC miners being developed in China, which would soon render graphics card mining futile. They were purpose-built pieces of hardware dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies, constantly driving down coin prices due to increased hash rates. I decided to hang tight as long as mining was even slightly profitable. There was still bread for the taking. And then something big happened: the release of Dogecoin.It was based on the wildly popular doge meme and had no real use cases or purpose. Being a huge fan of doge, I directed all my hashing power over to mine it, even though you couldn’t even sell it anywhere yet. I was betting hard on the fact that a useless meme coin had immense potential to go viral and end up precious.I managed to mine millions and millions of Dogecoins before it was inevitably listed on an online exchange. I welcomed the opening price with open arms and proceeded to unload them all for a profit of almost 10,000 euros. It was the big fish I had been waiting for. This was followed by a few more months of gradually lowering mining profits, after which I decided to call it quits.I sold whatever equipment I still could, trying to recoup as much money as possible from my battle-worn miner army. I paid off all my debts, bills and rent, and the cold realization hit me: I had nothing left over to show for it. A year of full-time effort spent, living in inhumane conditions, becoming a nervous wreck. And nothing?Back then it did indeed feel like nothing. But now those experiences are cherished memories of boldly jumping into the unknown, self-discovery and never staying stagnant in the progress of technology.And hey!

Others have departed my life in less permanent ways, but it still hurts that I can’t talk to them like I used to, that what we had doesn’t exist anymore. I am losing friends as we speak, watching what we had unravel one text message at a time. It breaks my heart fresh every time a friendship weakens or dies. Maybe I’m too sensitive.Some of my lost friends have come back to me: Becca and I didn’t speak for years, but now she’s one of my closest. A series of high school friends faded away ages ago, only to reappear now that we all watch Drag Race and have TikTok. It’s nice how that happens, but I don’t understand it. What makes some friends come back? What keeps others away?Others gently remind me that I am not the only person who has lost close friends, that this is part of life, and I know this is true. At the height of my friendship breakup with Lexi, I talked to other friends about my hurt constantly. Loved ones shared their own stories of important friendships suddenly dissolving without warning or respite. I know I’m not special.But sometimes the pain is so big that it feels like I am the only one, and this makes me wonder if I’m a narcissist. (My therapist says that if you’re worried you’re a narcissist, you’re not a narcissist, which gives me some comfort.) Everyone I talk to about these heartbreaks agrees on one thing: We don’t have enough of a cultural script for friend breakups. Maybe that’s why it feels like all of us are going it alone. Maybe that’s why I can’t get over it.Until recently, I could not digest raw tomatoes at all. They gave me terrible heartburn, made me feel sick, and for years I simply didn’t like the taste. For a long time, my chronic stomach illness was an easy excuse when I was served unwanted raw tomatoes in a dish: sure, I didn’t like them, but the effects on my gut were way more significant.But a couple of years ago, Kaitlyn and I went on a trip upstate, just to get out of the city for a while, and at the diner where we stopped for lunch I ordered a BLT. I couldn’t tell you why; it just sounded delicious, cool and creamy and crunchy on that warm September day. It was so good, I lost my mind over it. It changed my heart, tomatoes-wise.Ever since that sandwich, I eat tomatoes almost every day. I put them on toast atop a thin layer of ricotta. I stir them into pasta with roasted zucchini. Sometimes I pop them off the plant and eat them whole like butterscotch candies, the acidic juice exploding into my mouth a surprise every time. Sometimes my stomach is fine with it, and sometimes I pay the price with an aching gut and a fit of nausea.This is a bad habit of mine: taking something that’s not good for me but wanting it badly enough that I force my system to tolerate it. Tomatoes might make me sick. Still, I love them enough, now, that I’m always willing to take the risk.Here is something I’ve told Kaitlyn and nobody else: I dream constantly about the friends I’ve lost. Once a week I dream that Billy and I are hanging out, sometimes at a movie theater or at a bar or at a party, and in the dream I think to myself, “Isn’t this nice, that we sorted out our differences and we’re friends again? Aren’t you grateful?” It happens this way every single time.When I dream about Lexi, I am angry. This is how I know I haven’t resolved my feelings yet, that I still have more work to do in therapy. I dream of yelling and screaming and crying. I wake up mad. These dreams are not yet as frequent as my dreams about Billy, which I can count on like clockwork, but I’m remembering them more and more often.Perhaps these dreams are showing me where I failed in these friendships, the things I couldn’t bear to do in my conscious life: take up space, make my needs known, forgive and forget. (I check myself here: Am I the one who failed? Does it have to be anybody’s fault?)My therapist says I am holding onto a lot of trauma and guilt and pain about losing these friends, losing any friends, and I know that she is right. Sometimes I wish I could simply flush my brain of these friendships, forget they ever happened, instead of dealing with my hurt feelings over them. Even then, I bet they would still come to me in dreams, rendering the whole complicated process useless.And after all, not all of my friendship dreams are bad. Like when I dream about Casey? Well, I dream that he is still alive.We got Covid this summer and had to extend a vacation on the West Coast in order to isolate. For 12 days, my tomato plant went unwatered, unharvested. We came back and the leaves had mostly shriveled, but waiting for me was a bundle of bright red cherry tomatoes, huddled together as if for safety. I took them off the vine and ate them one by one.“Tomato plants are dramatic,” Kaitlyn tells me, and she’s right. A few hours after we have extensively watered the dried-out plant, its leaves curl out into lush greenery again. A few leaves stay dry and brown, but she tells me not to worry about them. She warns me, though, that we might not get as many tomatoes as we did last year because of our accidental abandonment of the plant. I am heartbroken.So I channel my emotions into plant care and love this one a little extra, checking on it constantly, whispering sweet nothings like a lover. “Grow, baby, grow,” I tell the small green bulbs emerging from flowers, thinking maybe I can will the plant into being what I need it to be. We just planted another cherry tomato seedling, a gift from a neighbor, and I’m curious to see if it will fruit in time for summer. Still, my loyalty lies with this one, my baby. I promise it that whatever it can give me is enough. After all, I am the one who left.Cherry tomatoes need some kind of support structure, like a trellis or stake, in order to grow. Without this support, the plant can get too heavy and refuse to hold up its own weight. Contact with wet soil increases the likelihood of disease or insects. When the plant is heavy, stems break. Half-ripe tomatoes drop to the ground, stymied before they can reach their full potential. The harvest is lackluster, the fruits wasted.A friendship takes the shape of its container. Ride-or-die, maid of honor, best friends forever. It, too, needs a structure in place to guide it, to help it grow.I will send this essay to my friends knowing that my words are not enough, knowing that too often I have made myself someone’s trellis when in fact what I needed was something safe to fall back on, something to make me feel secure. Too often I have tried and tried to force something to be good for me when it simply wasn’t. It is easy for me to crumble under my own weight, to aim too high and too big. It is easy for me to sacrifice myself. I am tired of wasting fruit.Casey, if you’re reading this, we miss you.Lexi, if you’re reading this, I would still bail you out of jail tomorrow.Billy, I know you’re not reading this.I plan to ask friends if they have any use for our tomatoes next time we travel, as well as the chives and cilantro and sage and bell pepper and the other good green things growing on our patio. Even though I won’t be here to enjoy them for some time, they should not go to waste.Since we returned from our extended absence, three more tomatoes have ripened, ready for picking. About two dozen more are coming in, still light green and fuzzy. With these, I will be patient. I will not pick them before they are ready. But with the red fruits, I do not bother to wait. I pluck one from its vine, wipe it on my shorts, and put the whole thing in my mouth. While it is still here with me, while the weather is still warm and growth is still possible and this plant has not yet died — I savor.Subscribe to my newsletter, Is This An Essay?, over at TinyLetter.'], ['Why I Started Tracking My Moods', 'Sandra Pawula', 'Oct 25', 'https://betterhumans.pub/why-i-started-tracking-my-moods-721a3b40b642?source=home---------97------------------0----------', 'I’ve started to track my moods and it’s proving to be an empowering experiment.

We’re both twenty-four; he obsesses over the number three, and I obsess over the number four. His OCD is hand sanitizer, a rollercoaster, and a lifetime of going through the motions. Mine is Facebook and eyelashes and asking questions I’d give anything not to ask.“It’s something I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life,” says Alex. I underline this in my notebook.**Alex rode a rollercoaster in the fall — the Cyclone, on Coney Island. Until that day he knew for a fact he was afraid of heights, thanks to a panic attack on a Disney World ride years before. But after he was diagnosed with OCD at sixteen, he began to keep a journal. As he started to recover, he wrote down everything he knew about himself: his favorite season (winter), his favorite color (red), the bands that he liked, his biggest fears. And as his illness receded, he found that the answers changed. His preferred season became spring; his color of choice, yellow. And he realized that he wasn’t afraid of heights. Or of people, or of staying alive after all.A miserable prologue: That’s how Alex defines every moment before he broke down in his boarding school bedroom, crying and vomiting for two long days until the school doctor asked him the question he didn’t know he’d been waiting to answer: Do you think you might need help? Before his diagnosis, he believed he just wasn’t built to function in society. “It was a relief to know it had a name,” he said. “And that other people had it.”Alex’s existence was OCD. He divided the world into multiples of three. He touched objects three times, repeated mantras three times, recited lines from books three times. And then he obsessed, calling or texting his father, who is a doctor, several times an hour with fears about his health. There wasn’t space left in his brain for anything else. He didn’t have friendships. He didn’t have hobbies. He went through the motions for show — playing sports, excelling at school. “There was no real person doing those things,” he said. “I learned to act how a normal kid should, but it was all a façade.”The façade wasn’t entirely effective. Alex’s schoolmates didn’t realize he was ill, but they did realize something was off. “I was bullied for twitching, for being strange, for being a nerd, for being reclusive, for hanging round the teachers,” he said. “I was stuffed in a locker once.”After touching a door handle or shaking someone’s hand, Alex would hastily sanitize his hands with Purell. “I couldn’t focus until I’d done it,” he said. In the company of others, he’d try to suppress the urge for as long as possible, for fear of the mockery that would follow. “I would hold out as long as I could until my mind exploded.”He lived numbly. “It was a constant state of a really bad state,” he said. “There’d be objectively good days, where from the outside, you’d think good things were happening, but it wouldn’t even register with me.”The inevitable end, Alex believed, was suicide. He couldn’t foresee living past sixteen. He imagined his gears wearing out, his engine failing, with no spark of humanity inside to reanimate them. The only reason he didn’t try to kill himself was because he was too busy obsessing, counting over and over to three.Recovery, through cognitive behavioral therapy and medication, was slow and excruciating. “If I had a million and one worries and could knock it down to a million by the end of the week, that was the biggest achievement in the world,” he said. Even now, at twenty-four, he considers himself years behind his peers in terms of social development. He performs confidence, conceals his conviction that he’ll only wind up rejected, and hopes that one day it will become the default.His photographic memory pulls him back against his wishes. “At least a few times a day I’m reminded of a visual image and an emotion, and I won’t know why,” he says. He reminds himself that time has passed, that he no longer exists only to obsess. But he never feels the illness is truly behind him. “I can’t forget the past,” he says. “I can’t escape it.”**When I first spoke to Alex, over Facebook, he told me he wouldn’t want himself any other way. Initially, before I spoke to him in person, I struggled not to take this personally, having spent a lifetime praying indiscriminately to please, please, wake up any other way. When we met, I asked him to clarify. “As much as I say I wouldn’t change who I am,” he said, “I would certainly like to change the way I got here. But I’m proud of myself. And I’m thankful.”Whenever Alex concedes a negative, he sandwiches it within a positive. When I ask if he’s happy now, he says, “I’m a thousand times happier than I was,” before admitting that there’s something ineffable that’s missing, something he understands only by its absence. “But I’m closer than I’ve ever been!”He sees obsession as a spectrum, one on which he’ll always be “just to the left of normal.” And he pictures happiness, whatever that means, in his future. He imagines he’ll still be anxious when he gets there, but he’ll be a thousand miles away from his boarding school bedroom floor. He’d be grateful to stay exactly as anxious as he is today, in fact, providing his obsessions don’t accelerate again. “That’s the goal!” he says.Alex is kinder and braver than I am. I find it hard to be grateful for surviving for so long, so many times. Some days I’m so angry I feel it in the speed of my heartbeat: at the kids who bullied me in school, at the interminable waiting lists for therapy, at the friends who didn’t understand or never thought to ask. And at myself, most of all, for putting that look on my parents’ faces, over and over again. Describing that look is hard and hurts too much. It hurts more to imagine how it feels.**The biggest lie about OCD is that it’s funny, though it is, at times. I laughed when Alex explained why his compulsive blinking in multiples of three — sometimes spiraling up to nine, eighteen, twenty seven — stopped him getting anything done: “Because, well, my eyes were closed.” I laugh when I remember running for the school bus barefoot every morning, brandishing my shoes and socks to flag down the driver, because I had to button and unbutton my uniform so many times — in multiples of four — that I could never quite find the time to clothe my feet.Still, I never manage to laugh when someone tells me about their alphabetized bookshelf, and how they’re “just so OCD” about those books.The second biggest lie is that OCD is only about compulsions. Only rituals, continued indefinitely, like washing your hands or flicking a light switch on and off or, indeed, like blinking or buttoning and unbuttoning a shirt. The rituals, people know. The intrusive thoughts that motivate them, they consider less. They can’t conceive of primarily obsessional obsessive-compulsive disorder, where the worries never transmute into a physical compulsion but balloon instead inside the brain. Or of the false memory, the Frankenstein’s monster of an intrusive thought, one ruminated over so long that it solidifies into a grotesque imitation of the truth. Or of trichotillomania, the disorder so often co-morbid with OCD that compels me to pull out my hair.I started pulling my eyelashes and eyebrows when I was fourteen. At first I picked the mascara from my lashes, and then I plucked the lashes from the root. Before school, I smeared my mam’s brown eyeliner into the gap in my right eyebrow, though the result was too dark and too warm toned and looked like the handiwork of a child with a crayon. In my final year of university, I squinted into the mirror and extracted my last eyelash with blunt tweezers. For the next four months, I watched my human face return and the pink-eyed rat I’d created fade away.My friends and family wince when I pull out my lashes, telling me it looks disgusting, or it creeps them out, or my eyes look red and sore. It’s not out of malice — they know I want to stop, and so they try to make me. But deploying shame against obsessive-compulsive disorder is like spraying gasoline to quench a fire. I am ashamed with every eyelash I remove. I’ve been ashamed for longer than my memory can recount. The shame only incites me to hurt myself more.**I’ve written and rewritten my own history of OCD, in notebooks and diaries no one will ever read. Each account I’ve squirreled away, for fear it’s too self-involved or too angry or too melodramatic. I’ve been actively writing it since I was sixteen. It started playing out long before I knew it had a name.Alex says there were signs of anxiety when he was an infant. I remember insisting on a particular breakfast cereal when I was six, because I had a math test that day and I was afraid the Cheerios were unlucky.My OCD assumed a recognizable form the first time around. By the time I was fourteen I was touching every item in my bedroom, while repeating a nonsensical phrase before I could go to sleep or leave the house. I ate, showered, and slept according to strict patterns, all governed by the number four. In bed, I lay facing the wall, my legs curled in the fetal position, and was not permitted to roll over or stretch out or release my right arm from under the pillow. When I wrote or typed, each line had to contain an even number of words, and the first and last word of the line had to contain an even number of letters, and the first and last letter had to be an arbitrarily assigned “good” letter, like A or Q or X. I couldn’t wear new clothes or allow a new item into my bedroom. Instead, I balled them into plastic bags and hid them under my mam’s bed. We screamed at each other every time she found them, because I didn’t know how to explain.I ate exactly four Cheerios for breakfast. I tucked in every chair at the dining table four, sixteen, thirty-two times. I wore the same too-short school trousers every day, to the endless amusement of two snickering boys on my bus. I repeated every number I ever saw sixteen times. Before long, I could recite by heart the phone number from every real estate agent’s placard in my hometown.After a brief round of cognitive behavioral therapy, my OCD returned, newly metamorphosed. I became acutely paranoid, compelled to ask every classmate if they were talking about me — which pretty soon they were, because I was demonstrably mental. Two years after I left that school, a boy sent me a mocking Facebook message, telling me he’d heard someone talking about me on the bus. I deleted the message. Then deactivated my account. And then I cried.The third, and worst, iteration of my illness was primarily obsessional OCD, which bloomed like mold when I was twenty. My anxiety zeroed in on the Internet. I scoured Facebook for entire days, searching for half-remembered status updates that inexplicably made my brain itch. I messaged classmates I barely knew when we took math together, let alone six years later, and begged them to delete photos where I appeared only as a dim shape in the background. I lost friends because I couldn’t explain why I needed an ancient wall post gone — not to them or to myself. I felt as though something else was steering the ship; as though every day I woke up to a mind that was less and less my own.I feared, too, that I was a bad person, who might have hurt people like childhood bullies had once hurt me. I agonized over things I’d said, and how they could have been interpreted. On the worst days, I tortured myself over things I’d never said at all.On one metro journey into the center of town, a teenage girl sat down opposite me, and I noticed a small pink pimple bubbling on her right cheek, almost exactly mirroring the one on my left. The train pulled away from the station, but I felt another engine rumble into action. Imagine if you pointed it out, said my brain. Imagine if you laughed at her. Imagine if you called her ugly. Imagine if you stood up, and pointed at her, and called her ugly, and shouted it over and over and over until she cried. The topic exhausted, the train veered onto another track. What if you did call her ugly, and you’ve just forgotten? said my brain, thunderous even as I turned up the volume of my headphones, knowing already that it wouldn’t work. Are you sure you didn’t say anything? She looks sad. Are you sure you didn’t call her ugly? I got off the train three stops early and hyperventilated on the platform, pressing my hands into my temples as if to squeeze out the thoughts.Obsessive thoughts calcify. Played on repeat, they settle into the crevices of the mind, occupying space reserved for memories. The worst ones become impossible to distinguish from the truth. I truly believed that I’d stood on a train and screamed at a teenage girl with a pimple. I emailed a writer I’d never met, apologizing for something I knew I’d never said. Whenever a celebrity died, I knew that it was the result of something I did or said, and I’d just forgotten how exactly I was involved.I took a year out of university and spent it imploding. When I returned, I graduated thanks to two factors. The first was a medication and therapy combination that finally, impossibly, seemed to work. The second, the ceaseless tenacity of my mam, who took a four-hour train to Oxford every weekend just to make sure I was eating and leaving my bedroom. Shakily, I stepped onto an upward trajectory, one I still tentatively ascend today.Now, I have mostly good days, with some bad ones peppered in between. At the very least, I can feed myself and leave my house, though my mam’s now an entire ocean away.Neither Alex or I can declare with any certainty that we’ll ever know a life without OCD. But for now, we are alive. For now, that is enough.**Alex appears relaxed and self-assured, but as he speaks, he picks frantically at his right thumb with his forefinger. I turn to record it in my notebook and notice I am twisting my ribbon bookmark around my own right forefinger, so tightly that my fingertip is milk-white from lack of circulation. We both, it turns out, habitually contort our fingers without realizing. And I can’t sit down to a paper tablecloth or see a paper label on a water bottle without shredding it like a hamster. We’re not on the brink anymore, but neither of us is calm.I ask Alex the same question several times before I realize I’m prodding for an answer I’m not going to get. I want him to tell me it hurts him, too, to hear people use “OCD” as a stand-in for “meticulous.” He never does. “I know that they don’t mean offense,” he says. “It’s just ignorance.”Last year I worked in a bookshop, and spent a significant portion of my days shaping and reshaping stacks of new crime paperbacks into fastidiously themed pyramids. It was my job, not a compulsion. If I let the pyramids disintegrate, no one I loved would die. But the jokes came all the same. One customer sidled towards me, in search of the children’s department, as I aligned the books with the edge of the table. “Do you work here?” she opened, grinning. “Or do you just have OCD?”A careers advisor declared, after I explained why I took a year out of university, that she must have OCD as well, because she worries a lot. A professor told me she was OCD about sentence structure. When I was fifteen and still newly diagnosed, I waited until the classroom was empty and told my favorite teacher why I arranged the same paperback on top of the same planner on top of the same workbook on my desk in every class. In response, he pointed conspiratorially to a neat pile of papers. “See?” he said. “I’m OCD too!”I can’t hate anyone for making OCD jokes, partly because it’s an unfortunate part of our lexicon — whether I like it or not — and partly because I’d have to hate most of the people I know. And I worry that I’m oversensitive, and that the twist in my gut when I hear a person described as “psycho,” or the erratic city weather as “bipolar,” is just an overreaction. I’m tired of being angry. I’ve been angry for far too long.But still I wonder, if mental illness wasn’t so widely perceived as a joke, whether I would have taken so long to tell my parents I was faltering. Whether it would have been quite so easy for the kids at Alex’s school or mine to take the piss out of us. Or whether, after I told a doctor that I couldn’t survive in this mind any longer, he would have sent me away with a generic antidepressant prescription and a flippant comment about how long the waiting lists for therapy were. I saw him again the same week, in the hospital, after swallowing every pill he had prescribed for me.The paramedics who put me in an ambulance left a plastic thermometer cap in my university bedroom. I kept it there for weeks. Whenever the obsessive thoughts threatened to overwhelm me again, I touched it, and tried to remind myself that this was an illness. That medical professionals had been here, in my room. That the doctors and the medication were the truth, and the clamoring in my head was not. To me, one of the cruelest tricks of mental illness is its ability to convince the sufferer that it isn’t there at all.**Before my initial diagnosis, I had carried a wooden coffee stirrer from Starbucks in my coat pocket at all times. I knocked on wood compulsively, afraid that if I didn’t, simple statements of fact — “I have three siblings”; “I have two cats” — would become horribly and immediately untrue. Conversely, I couldn’t walk barefoot on a wooden floor, or touch paper with bare hands. I feared that by touching any derivative wood product, I’d actualize any negative thought that flitted through my mind. When writing in school, I rested my hand on a plastic ruler or the cuff of my sweater to avoid touching the workbook. “It’s because I’m left-handed,” I lied to curious classmates. “My hand will smudge the ink.”You learn to fight these things. Months after I began therapy, I practiced reciting sentences aloud while sitting on my hands. Exposure therapy, the psychologist explained. “I have a mam and a dad,” I said, resisting the twitch of my fingers towards the wooden window frame. “I have two brothers and a sister.” Next, I took off my socks and stood on the wooden floor. “I failed all my classes,” I said, “and my family are disappointed in me.” Unable to stand still, I paced in tight circles around my bedroom. “My family is dead. My family is dead. My family is dead.”Other compulsions were easier to rationalize away. Few would argue that any lives depended on my four morning Cheerios. Most would agree that I could roll over in bed without jeopardizing my future. The people around me knock on wood without a thought, barely even realizing that they do it. For them, the compulsion passes within seconds. For me, it grows roots.In every coffee shop I enter, I look at the stirrers for a second too long. Carrying one would be easier, I think, than rummaging through my makeup bag for an eye pencil, smearing the color on my hands as I touch the sliver of exposed wood at the tip. It would be less conspicuous than lunging toward the first tree I spot on the sidewalk. But it’s important to resist, I remind myself. And I have, so far.Still, I’m typing this with my forearms primly elevated. My desk is wooden. I can’t let my elbows touch.Emily Dixon is a post-graduate Fellow in Narrative Nonfiction at the Columbia Journalism School.

As I near my Powderhorn home, domestic boulevards overtake the lights of the small commercial center in my rearview. It’s just past 11:30 p.m.Outside of downtown, it’s hard to escape the modesty of urban life in Minneapolis. This is no concrete jungle, more like an overgrown prairie with lakes and sidewalks. But all that is frozen over now — winter holds its grudges.I am trailing two cars, homeward bound, with no real sense of urgency. Before long, about a half-block in front of me, two objects appear in the street. These are not cars, but something smaller. I’m not sure what I’m looking at. It’s snowing again, and the flurry blurs focus like a pixelated television. Foot hovering over the brakes, I keep driving, prepared for any sudden stops.As I get closer, I discern two figures. They walk urgently, weaving back and forth through the passing vehicles. I inch closer to the pedestrians, careful not to make the wrong move, especially on these Minneapolis streets where cars glide for yards on carpets of black ice.The vehicles ahead of me swerve slightly and honk, avoid the first person, and drive away. As I get closer, I see that it’s a woman. She rushes toward my car, waving her left hand in the air. Her gaze meets mine as I pass. I see her eyes, wide and dark — they scream with fright, like prey.I swerve out of the way, too, her body glancing past my driver’s side window. Despite the cold, she’s only wearing a tank top and jeans. She’s also holding the right side of her head, as if in pain. Her mouth is open, her face stretched sideways in what looks like exhaustion.She’s tall, maybe five feet, 10 inches. Her skin is light brown, and she has messy, dark hair and deep-set eyes. My guess is she’s Native American, given her presence in this part of South Minneapolis. Most of our streets and lakes — hell, even the state — are named after Native peoples. Most now live in homes scattered around these blocks, but some are in the nearby projects off Cedar Avenue.Then I pass the second figure, a man, looking possessed. He’s short, with piercing eyes, gritted teeth, and persistence in every step. His energy is almost otherworldly, like the rabid dog I once saw in Sierra Leone. Unlike his companion, he does not glance my way or notice cars on the road. He’s fixed on the woman, walking rapidly in her direction with what appears to be a thick wool sweater in his right hand.I drive past him, struggling to sync this information in my mind. I remind myself to look forward to avoid a crash. Mere seconds ago, I assumed these were drunken college kids playing in the streets. Now I understand otherwise.The drivers in front of me continue on as if they’ve seen nothing. Selfishly, I want to do the same. I want to go home, to sleep. And I try. But after another half block, I pull over and take a heavy breath. I’m conflicted. Do you want to do this? Favoring instinct over reason, I turn the corner and circle the block.When I approach again, the woman is crossing the four-way intersection, heading north down Bloomington Avenue. The man is still following her from the other side, some 20 yards behind. I speed up, cut between them, and turn right to follow the woman. With the man in my rearview, I drive up several yards to where the woman continues her seemingly desperate escape.I watch for cars coming from the other direction, drive up the middle of the street, and pull up next to the woman. She darts away from the car at first, likely assuming I’m trying to pass her. Instead, I roll down the window to ask if she’s alright.“Ma’am, are you okay?” Of course she’s not.She jumps, startled by the voice. Though the night is quiet, my mind is loud. I question my decision to intercede. Is this wise? I’m a man, too, after all. A Black man at that.“Ma’am! Are you alright?”The woman comes to her senses and yells through tears and melted snow, “No, no! Please help! Can I have a ride?”“Of course.”I’m startled by my confidence, and suddenly wary of a potential trap or ploy. Yet I lean over and try to open the passenger door. It’s frozen shut.I glance in the rearview mirror, anxious that our brief moments of stillness have let the man draw close. And they have. His steps quicken as he sees the woman prepare to enter the car. Looking toward him, her hands fumble the handle a couple more times.“Pull hard!” I yell, my heart beating in my ears.After two or three seconds that feel like minutes, she gives a final tug that cracks the seal of ice. She opens the door and the car is instantly overcome by frigid air, its warmth suctioned away. The woman slams the door and I drive. The man, about to reach the car, begins to run. Each footstep is a stammer, hands flailing in the air as he fades from view.The initial silence is accompanied by the woman’s heavy, unsteady breathing. The passenger side window fogs up as she catches her breath. From the corner of my eye, I see her many colorful tattoos. Her facial features are pronounced, her cheekbones high and wide, chin low, almost triangular.Goosebumps climb her bare arms as if the cold air is catching up to her shock. Shaking, she leans forward for a few moments, her face in her hands. Her right hand combs through her hair but quickly pulls away as she curses under her breath. A large wound irritates the side of her scalp.I again ask my senseless question. “Are you alright?” I feel at a loss.She says nothing at first, tries only to steady her breath. Then, tucking her head into her lap, she starts repeating to herself, “No, no, no, no…”I heed her energy. I say nothing, sensing she’s not ready for conversation. Instead, I blast the heat and keep driving past the turnoff for my home.Not knowing where I’m going, I ask her again, timidly. “Ma’am, are you alright?” She instantly bursts into tears. I add “I’m so sorry. Is there somewhere I can take you?”Slow to comfort, she begins to open up. She tells me more than I asked for, as if processing it for herself. She tells me the man, a friend, was on a drunken binge at a local bar. Then he got loud and handsy with her. When she tried to get him to stop, he became violent, pushing and hitting her in front of the other patrons. When staff tried to interfere, she ran out the front door into the cold air. He began chasing her, and he didn’t stop until the moment we drove away.In the scramble, she tells me, he stripped her of her sweater and shirt, where she’d pocketed her wallet and phone. She was down to her white tank top and ripped jeans.“No one would stop and help.” Her voice is deep. “It felt like I was running for 30 minutes.”The thought of the man trailing her sickens me. She complains about her aching head, a small patch of hair pulled from her scalp in the scuffle. We’re seeing each other now, eye to eye. I empathize as best I can, knowing I’ve never been in her position.“God bless you,” she says, but I call my worth into question. Her words are genuine and grateful, but I receive them with shame. There were so many times I never stopped.“Is there somewhere I can take you? I’ll drive you wherever.”She’s uncertain of where to go. While she thinks about my question, I ask her if it’s alright to stop at my house, now two miles behind us.“Maybe I have an old sweater or something I can give you.”She agrees and I circle back. When I arrive home it’s nearing midnight. I park the car and hesitate for a moment with my hands on the keys. I want to keep the car warm for her, but the cynic in me wonders if it’s smart to leave her alone in my car and with my keys. Again trusting instinct over reason, I detach my house key from the chain and rush inside, the car still on.“I’ll be right back.”My mutt of a dog, Franklin, jumps to his feet as I enter and follows me to my bedroom on the opposite side of the house. He trots behind me, long nails clacking on wooden floorboards like a miniature horse. I don’t entertain him like I normally would. Instead, I burrow through my closet to secure the thickest, warmest sweatshirt I can find. It’s the one my grandfather — Opa, my family calls him — gave me when I turned 18. It’s too big for me, but that’s why I like it. It makes me feel protected, hidden. It’s the same reason I always wear a hat. I hesitate again but swallow my creeping regrets. Before heading back out, I grab the $25 that rests in the top drawer of my dresser.As I walk out of the bedroom, I pass myself in the mirror hanging from the closet door. I look tired. My withered brown boots, khaki pants, leather coat, and baseball cap only seem to mask what rests beneath. The growing beard on my face makes me look like my father, with whom I’ve just reconnected. My eyes are dark and cumbersome, and the endless white of winter has turned my brown skin pale.I peer down at Franklin in the mirror, who sits at my feet and cocks his head, silken eyes amused by the look of me. I chuckle and return to the car.When I see the vehicle still parked outside my house, I silently reprimand myself for doubting her. I hand her the sweatshirt and the money and she timidly accepts both, putting on the sweatshirt right away. It fits her better than it fit me.“Have you thought about where you’d like to go?” The energy in the car has steadied. It’s calm, collected. “Seriously,” I add, “You name it.”She directs me to a house a couple of miles away, where a girlfriend lives. She calls her friend on my phone, confirming they’re there, and we drive off once again. On the way, she asks me my name. I’m reminded that we’ve shared this entire experience without knowing each other’s names.“Matthew.”“Oh, I love that name. That’s one of my favorite names.”I smile and I accept it. I don’t care if she’s being sincere or not. “Thanks. And you?”“My name is Mary.”I pause, shocked by her response.“That’s my mom’s name,” I tell her. She can hear the excitement in my voice.“No way,” she says through a smile. I picture my mom, likely asleep on her bed or the couch with the TV on and a blanket half draped over her body, aging gracefully in her quaint uptown apartment.I learn a lot about Mary in those two miles to her friend’s house. She was released from jail two weeks prior, some days before Thanksgiving. She was caught selling weed two years ago, and they locked her up. She talks about the difficulty of putting all the pieces back into place — calls it “a puzzle.”“It’s really hard when you get out,” she says. “Everything feels like a trap. It feels like everyone I know has turned their backs on me.”I can feel her weight, and I try to lighten the mood. “How was your Thanksgiving?”Mary’s face lights up. She tells me about her “tiny” new apartment in the Phillips neighborhood, and how she hosted seven members of her large family. Her energy has completely changed. Her voice is higher now, and she’s sitting almost straight up, her hands animating every word. I’m touched by her warm spirit, as if she’s transferring it to me.“Do you have any children?” I ask.“Eight,” she says proudly.Eight? My surprise is honest. That’s a hell of a lot of children. I’m reminded of my own five siblings — three of whom I don’t know.“Were they around for Thanksgiving?” I ask, digging deeper.She begins to break down again, finds it difficult to muster words. I don’t know her, but I feel like I do. I feel like I’m conversing with a different iteration of my spiritual and emotional self — one less privileged, but similarly broken and dejected.She tells me she lost all eight children to the foster care system, and that this most recent arrest was not her first time in trouble with the law. There was no father around to support the kids, so the state took them away. I think of my father and his children, each shaped in some way by his absence, though to a lesser extreme. Mary brought the case to court and fought for custody, but ultimately lost.“I tried so hard… I did everything I could,” she says. I believe her.Her friend is waiting behind the front door screen when we arrive, the light behind her casting a large shadow on her front lawn. I slow the car to a halt, uncertain about how to end what feels like a scripted drama. But Mary turns to me, leans in for a half-hug in Opa’s oversized sweatshirt, gently grabs my hand, and looks me in the eyes.“Miigwech.” She pronounces it “meeg-way-ch.”I must look puzzled. She laughs a warm laugh and says it again, “Miigwech. It means ‘thank you’ in my language. I’m Ojibwe.”“Wow…” All I can muster before she leaves is, “Thank you.”think about Mary often. I wonder where she is, what she’s doing, and if she ever got her kids back. It took me months to begin chronicling this experience, and six years to publish it. There was too much to process, too much to learn and grow from. That hour with Mary shaped me (and continues to shape me) in a way no other has. The experience reflected all I’d buried deep in my own life. It laid bare the pains of childhood and trials of adulthood, the fragmentation of family, the patient mending of my spirit.For one, she reminded me of my mom, who was also a survivor of senseless violence and abuse at the hands of a man — my father, in particular. My mother suffered her own wounds, her own bruises. It took me years to look at her without invoking her pain. Growing up as her son and her support system, I was overcome with guilt. I was away, struggling through my first couple months at DePaul University, while the abuse happened. As a result, I processed her experience selfishly, focusing on my own guilt over not being more present for her. It took time to see past the traumas she endured, and to see her not as a victim but as everything she deemed more important: a mother, sister, partner, friend, and entrepreneur.It took time for me to understand that just because my mother doesn’t talk about her pain anymore doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel it and think about it, or that she’s not fundamentally changed by it. Seeing my father, however cordial they might be now, is a bitter reminder of the ways male fragility tore down trust and a familial bedrock three decades in the making.Second, my experience that winter night forced me to confront my male fragility. In the man who chased Mary, I saw the same wild and turbulent eyes I’d often seen in my father. And I recognized in them both something all too familiar: a man so afraid of his own shadow that he takes his pain out on others. A man so incapable of processing emotions that he either implodes or explodes. And this scared the hell out of me, knowing with all my sensitivities and emotions and expressiveness, I still felt caged by the toxic ways boys are conditioned to subdue hurt.I feared the power in my hands. That a man as meek and jovial as my father could turn so calloused. That in time, one could become so repressed that their very temperament changes. I hated admitting that the discontent and anger I felt toward my father was not much unlike the anger that changed him. That our two-year severance was not dissimilar from the one between him and his stepfather, who’d abused his mother. How cyclical and generational our pain.My encounter with Mary also forced me to reckon with my complicity as a leader and philanthropist. I thought of when I stayed home instead of participating in the local protest. When I denied the gaze of someone less privileged peddling for food on the street. Comfort was a reliable and convenient choice, not a moral one. I engaged in coddling behaviors, like seeking a male friend’s atonement before protecting the peace and well-being of the harmed. I wasn’t nobler than the average person. I was merely thrust, uncomfortably, past the passive role of bystander into the active role of resister. I was embarrassed by this, knowing that at a different time or place or state of mind, I would have been one of the many people to drive on by. So many of us are distracted, busy waiting for joy and contentment in our own lives that we forget about the sacredness of everyone else’s, like Mary.Without trying, Mary sobered me, helped me see my shortcomings as an ally to those in need. I did something humane that night to be sure, but in return, I was confronted with the limits of my compassion. How conditional is my consciousness? How do all my good intentions perform in the face of tribulation? Do I engage in justice as much as I speak about it? Allyship is about action and impact because intention alone is both partial and vain. Well-intentioned people sometimes cause the greatest harm.I do wish I could see Mary again, to return her “God bless you” and tell her about all the ways her resilience inspired me. That though I wish we met under different circumstances and though these meditations do not rectify what she went through, the warmth of her heart and the honesty of her voice reminded me of the power of human connection. That she presented something raw and real of herself to a stranger in a world that had (at least recently) been nothing but cruel to her.I do not define Mary by her pain but see her instead for all she aspired to be for herself and her family. She remains my reminder of the depths that exist in us all, the trials that inevitably shake us, and the possibilities that keep us moving.'], ['Working From Home Tanked My Productivity', 'Barry Davret', 'Sep 13', 'https://barry-davret.medium.com/working-from-home-tanked-my-productivity-24ebe08a792?source=home---------300------------------0----------', 'Not long ago, I wrote several viral stories about productivity.

Failure comes in many forms, but I’m especially interested in situations in which people *perceive* something as failing (or about to fail) and the contestations over failure that often arise in such situations. Given this, it’s hard not to be fascinated by all that’s unfolding around Twitter. At this point in the story of Musk’s takeover, there’s a spectrum of perspectives about Twitter’s pending doom (or lack thereof). But there’s more to failure than the binary question of “will Twitter fail or won’t it?” Here’s some thoughts on how I’m thinking about the failure question…I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the aughts trying to understand the rise and fall of social network sites like Friendster and MySpace. I noticed something fascinating. If a central node in a network disappeared and went somewhere else (like from MySpace to Facebook), that person could pull some portion of their connections with them to a new site. However, if the accounts on the site that drew emotional intensity stopped doing so, people stopped engaging as much. Watching Friendster come undone, I started to think that the fading of emotionally sticky nodes was even more problematic than the disappearance of segments of the graph.With MySpace, I was trying to identify the point where I thought the site was going to unravel. When I started seeing the disappearance of emotionally sticky nodes, I reached out to members of the MySpace team to share my concerns and they told me that their numbers looked fine. Active uniques were high, the amount of time people spent on the site was continuing to grow, and new accounts were being created at a rate faster than accounts were being closed. I shook my head; I didn’t think that was enough. A few months later, the site started to unravel.On a different project, I was talking with a cis/hetero dating site that was struggling with fraud. Many of its “fake” accounts were purportedly “women” but they were really a scam to entice people into paying for a porn site. But when the site started removing these profiles, they found that the site as a whole was unraveling. Men didn’t like these fake women, but their profiles enticed them to return. Moreover, attractive women saw these profiles and felt like it was a site full of people more attractive than them so they came. When the fake women disappeared, the real women disappeared. And so did the men.Network effects intersect with perception to drive a sense of a site’s social relevance and interpersonal significance.I don’t have access to the Twitter social graph these days, but I’d bet my bottom dollar that it would indicate whether or not the site was on a trajectory towards collapse. We are certainly seeing entire sub-networks flock to Mastodon, but that’s not as meaningful as people might think because of the scale and complexity of the network graph. You can lose whole segments and not lose a site. However, if those departing are creating Swiss cheese into the network graph, then I would worry.The bigger question concerns those emotionally sticky nodes. What constitutes a “can’t be missed” account or post varies. What draws someone to a service like Twitter varies. For some, it is the libidinal joy of seeing friends and community, the posts that provide light touch pleasure and joy. For others, it’s a masochistic desire for seeing content that raises one’s blood pressure. Still others can’t resist the drama of a train wreck.The funny thing about Twitter’s feed algorithms is that they were designed to amplify the content that triggered the most reaction, those emotionally sticky posts. This is why boring but informative content never has a chance against that which prompts fury. But it also means that we’re all watching how our little universe of content is changing (or not). Are you still seeing the things that give you pleasure? Or just the stuff that makes you angry? Why can’t you resist looking away from the things that give you pain? (That question isn’t a new one… it’s the question that underlies our toxic social media ecology more generally.)I have to give Musk and gang some credit for knowing that drama brings traffic. The drama that unfolds in the World Cup is wholesome compared to the drama of watching public acts of humiliation, cruelty, and hate. We’re in a modern day Coliseum watching a theater of suffering performed for the king under the rubric of “justice.” And just like the ancient Romans, we can’t look away.But how long can the spectacle last? Even the Roman Empire eventually collapsed, but perhaps the theater of the absurd can persist for a while. Still, there are other factors to consider.Nearly everyone I talk with is surprised that the actual service of Twitter is mostly still working. What that says to me is that the engineering team was far more solid than I appreciated. Any engineering team worth its salt is going to build redundancy and resilience into the system. Exceptions that are thrown should be caught and managed. But that doesn’t mean that a system can persist indefinitely without maintenance and repair.Think of it in terms of a house. If you walk away from your home for a while, the pipes will probably keep working fine on their own. Until a big freeze comes. And then, if no one is looking, they’ll burst, flood the house, and trigger failure after failure. The reason for doing maintenance is to minimize the likelihood of this event. And the reason to have contingencies built in is to prevent a problem from rippling across the system.What happens when Twitter’s code needs to be tweaked to manage an iOS upgrade? Or if a library dependency goes poof? What happens when a security vulnerability isn’t patched?One interesting concept in organizational sociology is “normal accidents theory.” Studying Three Mile Island, Charles Perrow created a 2x2 grid before b-schools everywhere made this passé.One axis represented the complexity of interactions in a system; the other axis reflected the “coupling” of a system. A loosely coupled system has little dependencies, but a tightly coupled system has components that are highly dependent on others. Perrow argued that “normal accidents” were nearly inevitable in a complex, tightly coupled system. To resist such an outcome, systems designers needed to have backups and redundancy, safety checks and maintenance. In the language of computers, resilience requires having available “buffer” to manage any overflow.Having dozens of engineers working around the clock to respond to crises can temporarily prevent failure. But those engineers will get tired, mistakes will happen, and maintenance will get kicked down the road. Teams need buffer as much as systems do.I’m concerned about the state of the team at Twitter, not just because so many people were laid off. If my hunch is right, many of the engineers who are keeping Twitter going fall into four groups. There are immigrants on H1Bs who are effectively indentured servants, many of whom would leave if they could, but the industry is falling apart which makes departures unlikely. There are also apolitical engineers who need a job and there are few jobs to be found in the industry right now. Neither of these groups will want to drive themselves to the bone in the long term. Then there are Musk fanboys who want to ride this rollercoaster for whatever personal motivation. And there are goons on loan from other public companies that Musk owns. (Side note: how how how is it legal for Musk to use employees from public companies for his private project!?!? Is this something that the Delaware courts are going to influence?)In the early days of Twitter, moments of failure were celebrated with a Fail Whale, the iconic image that Twitter posted when something went terribly awry in the system, requiring it to be shut down and, effectively, rebooted. It’s been a long time since we saw the Fail Whale because there was a strong infrastructure team who worked to bake resilience into the system. In other words, Twitter grew up.How long can the resilience of the system allow it to keep functioning? It could be quite a while. But I also can’t help but think of a video I saw years ago about what would happen to New York City if the humans suddenly disappeared overnight. First the pipes burst and the rats invaded. But without humans leaving behind trash, the rats eventually died. The critters that remained? The cockroaches of course.If you searched for “miserable failure” (or even just “failure”) on September 29, 2006, the first result was the official George W. Bush biography. This act of “Google bombing” made the internet lol. But it also hinted at a broader dynamic related to failure. There are failures that everyone can agree are failures (e.g. the explosion of the Challenger), but most failures are a matter of perception.Politicians, policies, companies, and products are often deemed a “failure” rhetorically by those who oppose them, regardless of any empirical measure one might use. George W. Bush was deemed a failure by those who were opposed to his “War on Terrorism.” Declaring something a failure is a way to delegitimize it. And when something is delegitimized, it can become a failure.I often think back to MySpace’s downfall. In 2007, I penned a controversial blog post noting a division that was forming as teenagers self-segregated based on race and class in the US, splitting themselves between Facebook and MySpace. A few years later, I noted the role of the news media in this division, highlighting how media coverage about MySpace as scary, dangerous, and full of pedophiles (regardless of empirical evidence) helped make this division possible. The news media played a role in delegitimizing MySpace (aided and abetted by a team at Facebook, which was directly benefiting from this delegitimization work).Perception (including racism and classism) have shaped the social media landscape since the beginning.A lot has changed about our news media ecosystem since 2007. In the United States, it’s hard to overstate how the media is entangled with contemporary partisan politics and ideology. This means that information tends not to flow across partisan divides in coherent ways that enable debate. In general, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the left declare conservative politicians/policies to be failures, this has little impact on the right because it is actively ignored by the media outlets consumed by those on the right. But interestingly, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the right declare progressive politicians/policies to be failures, both mainstream media and the left obsessively amplify falsehoods and offensive content in an attempt to critique and counteract them. (Has anyone on the left managed to avoid hearing about the latest round of celebrity anti-Semitism?)I’m especially fascinated by how the things that are widely deemed failures are deemed failures for different reasons across the political spectrum. Consider the withdrawal in Afghanistan. The right did a fantastic job of rhetorically spinning this as a Biden failure, while the left criticized aspects of the mission. This shared perception of failure landed in the collective public consciousness; there was no need to debate why individual groups saw it as failure. Of course, this also meant that there was no shared understanding of what led to that point, no discussion of what should’ve been done other than it should’ve been done better. Perceptions of failure don’t always lead to shared ideas of how to learn from these lessons.The partisan and geopolitical dimensions of perception related to Twitter are gobsmacking. Twitter has long struggled to curb hate, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, and harassment. For a long time, those on the right have labeled these efforts censorship. Under the false flag of freedom of speech, the new Twitter has eradicated most safeguards, welcoming in a new era of amplified horrors, with the news media happily covering this spectacle. (This is what led Joan Donovan and I to talk about the importance of strategic silence.)Musk appears to be betting that the spectacle is worth it. He’s probably correct in thinking that large swaths of the world will not deem his leadership a failure either because they are ideologically aligned with him or they simply don’t care and aren’t seeing any changes to their corner of the Twitterverse.He also appears to believe that the advertising community will eventually relent because they always seem to do so when an audience is lingering around. And with a self-fashioned Gladiator torturing his enemies for sport in front of a live audience, there are lots of dollars on the table. Musk appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out.So the big question in my mind is: how effective will the perception that Twitter is failing be in the long run, given how it is not jumping across existing ideological divisions? Perception of failure can bring about failure, but it doesn’t always. That’s the story of many brands who resist public attacks. Perception of failure can also just fade into the background, reifying existing divisions.Of course, a company needs money and the only revenue stream Twitter has stems from advertising. This is one of the reasons that activism around the advertisers matters. If advocates can convince advertisers to hold out, that will starve a precarious system. That is a tangible way to leverage perception of failure. Same can be said if advocates manage to convince Apple or Google to de-list. Or if perception can be leveraged into court fights, Congressional battles, or broader policy sanctions. But right now, it seems as though perception has gotten caught in the left/right cultural war that is unfolding in the United States.There are many ways in which the Twitter story could end, but it’s important to remember that most companies do eventually end (or become unrecognizable after 100+ years). The internet is littered with failed companies. And even though companies like Yahoo! still have a website, they are in a “permanently failing” status. Most companies fail when they run out of money. And the financials around Twitter are absurd. As a company, it has persisted almost entirely on a single profit stream: advertising. That business strategy requires eyeballs. As we’ve already witnessed, a subscription plan for salvation is a joke.The debt financing around Twitter is gob-smacking. I cannot for the life of me understand what the creditors were thinking, but the game of finance is a next level sport where destroying people, companies, and products to achieve victory is widely tolerated. Historical trends suggest that the losers in this chaos will not be Musk or the banks, but the public.For an anchor point, consider the collapse of local news journalism. The myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn’t give a shit about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of town. So financiers squeezed the news orgs until there was no money to be squeezed and then they hung them out to dry. There was no configuration in which local news was going to survive, no magical upwards trajectory of revenue based on advertising alone. If it weren’t for craigslist and Google, the financiers would’ve squeezed these enterprises for a few more years, but the end state was always failure. Failure was the profit strategy for the financiers. (It still boggles my mind how many people believe that the loss of news journalism is because of internet advertising. I have to give financiers credit for their tremendous skill at shifting the blame.)I highly doubt that Twitter is going to be a 100-year company. For better or worse, I think failure is the end state for Twitter. The question is not if but when, how, and who will be hurt in the process?Right now, what worries me are the people getting hurt. I’m sickened to watch “journalists” aid and abet efforts to publicly shame former workers (especially junior employees) in a sadistic game of “accountability” that truly perverts the concept. I’m terrified for the activists and vulnerable people around the world whose content exists in Twitter’s databases, whose private tweets and DMs can be used against them if they land in the wrong hands (either by direct action or hacked activity). I’m disgusted to think that this data will almost certainly be auctioned off.Frankly, there’s a part of me that keeps wondering if there’s a way to end this circus faster to prevent even greater harms. (Dear Delaware courts, any advice?)No one who creates a product wants to envision failure as an inevitable end state. Then again, humans aren’t so good at remembering that death is an inevitable end state either. But when someone doesn’t estate plan, their dependents are left with a mess. Too many of us have watched the devastating effects of dementia and, still, few of us plan for all that can go wrong when our minds fall apart and we lash out at the ones we love. Few companies die a graceful death either. And sadly, that’s what I expect we’re about to see. A manic, demented creature hurting everyone who loved it on its way out the door.I’m not omniscient. I don’t know where this story ends. But after spending the last few years obsessing over what constitutes failure, I can’t help but watch this situation with a rock in my stomach.Failure isn’t a state, but a process. It can be a generative process. After all, some plants only grow after a forest fire. (And yes, yes, tech is currently obsessed with “fail fast.” But frankly, that’s more about a status game than actually learning.)Failure should not always be the end goal. There’s much to be said about the journey, about living a worthy life, about growing and learning and being whole. Yet, what keeps institutions, systems, companies, and products whole stems from how they are configured within a network of people, practices, and perception. Radical shifts in norms, values, and commitments can rearrange how these networks are configured. This is why transitions are hard and require a well-thought through strategy to prevent failure, especially if the goal is to be whole ethically.Watching this situation unfold, a little voice keeps nagging in my head. How should our interpretation of this situation shift if we come to believe that failure is the desired end goal? There’s a big difference between a natural forest fire and one that stems from the toxic mixture of arson and climate change.'], ['Ken Burns’ Message of Warning to America', 'Micah Sifry', 'Sep 30', 'https://micahsifry.medium.com/ken-burns-message-of-warning-to-america-813c9bd31c4?source=home---------206------------------0----------', 'The final minutes of the last episode of the new three-part documentary “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” produced by Ken Burns, Lynn Novick, and Sarah Botstein, are not about the Holocaust.'], ['Living And Dying In The Attention Economy', 'David Milgrim', 'Nov 2', 'https://davidmilgrim.medium.com/living-and-dying-in-the-attention-economy-370ff8d2ed21?source=home---------59------------------0----------', 'Everybody wants to be seen.

I had just stepped off a 13-hour flight from London, where I had spent the past 2 years. (Technically the flight was from Stockholm where I had been visiting friends for a long weekend, but regardless — )I wasn’t going far — just to Menlo Park, where I was to be staying on a friend’s sofa — but this was before you could assume everyone had a magic box in their pocket that could solve more or less any problem in a few taps. 6 weeks before, when I had been staying with the same friend while interviewing for a new job, I had to get a GPS with my rental car to find my way around. It was a strange, liminal time. Everyone could feel that the world had fundamentally changed but the oncoming wave of mobile technology was still primitive and limited, an often frustrating glimmer of its full potential.Eventually I navigated to El Camino Real and from there down to the vicinity of the Stanford campus.I was staying with my friend Brian. Back then he was a Ph.D student at Stanford, but in college we had been roommates. We both came from the midwest and played percussion in some of the university’s various ensembles so we’d grown close. Despite the fact I had spent the four years between college and my stint on his couch hopping between New York, DC, and London in various finance jobs while he headed straight west for his doctoral studies, we were able to pick up more or less where we left off. We played foosball in his living room, obsessed over Farmville (I was interviewing at a couple of mobile gaming companies), and talked about relationships and where our lives were going until the small hours. The normal, somewhat banal mid-20-something navel-gazing.And so moving to the Bay Area in 2011 was easy. Social networking was still novel enough that I could simply search Facebook for people I knew in San Francisco, message them, and get a lot of enthusiastic responses. People weren’t yet jaded about being perpetually online. In fact, that’s how I found my first roommate — a friend of a friend who would go on to co-found Instacart. This was the era of the Facebook Effect, when the larger narrative around these platforms was one of their ability to foster positive change and connect people. The notion that they could channel our cruelest impulses, addict us, and grow into a modern panopticon was not yet what people discussed at dinner parties.The Bay, the epicenter of everything tech, had a special kind of giddy energy. It was far different from the cities I had recently left behind: New York, Washington D.C., and London. San Francisco was friendly, encouraging, “yes and” — seemingly everyone I met earnestly thought they were changing the world for the better. And when they weren’t, they were rock climbing, playing in bands, performing stand-up comedy, making art, dancing on the beach until sunrise, and willing their wildest dreams into existence. The Bay was the home of the Black Panthers, the Hell’s Angels, Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters, The Whole Earth Catalog, and all the descendants of that family tree. You can more or less draw a straight line from the end of World War II through the biker gangs, the hipsters, the civil rights movements, and the hippies straight to Apple Computer, Burning Man, and Google. It wasn’t just that people in the Bay believed they could change the world: they knew they could. All the proof they needed was all around them.Last Thursday I loaded most of my possessions onto a truck. After eleven and a half years, I’m leaving San Francisco — for now.What changed? Is it not still true that the Bay is home to the hackers and misfits who are dreaming up and building a better future?I could cynically weave a narrative about how, in the last decade, the underdogs went mainstream. The pirates became the navy. Startups became The Man. How now every newly-minted MBA rushes out to Silicon Valley with a business plan in hand to build the next “Uber for X” squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of a yet-to-be-digitized industry and that entrepreneurship is just another career ladder. How the real rebels have moved on to weirder pastures and geography is no longer relevant: we all live in the metaverse already, and those who understand that are the ones living in the future, poised to build the next big thing.I could bemoan the sclerotic San Francisco government and its inability to solve basic problems despite vast resources: homelessness, housing costs, property crime, and quality of life concerns. People earnestly debate the role of racial and class equity in preventing public transit fare-jumping, prosecuting individuals shoplifting or selling stolen goods, and open-air drug dealing and consumption. Both sides feel righteous in their anger. The basic social contract is visibly fraying. These things matter.I could note the dissonance between how small teams can build world-changing products and the Bay Area’s collective lack of political will to allow for change. How the region’s politics are dominated by attachment to ideas about the way things should be rather than acceptance of the way things are. How our fixation on aesthetic ideals about how the world should work — from housing to transportation to opening a business — beggars the vast human potential both already living in the Bay Area and that wants to move here. (Despite bad governance, the Bay Area is still growing faster than anywhere else in the country.) How this all amounts to a massive failure of imagination, of aspiration, and of belief in humanity’s potential.Those are all stories I could tell about my relationship to the Bay Area — and none of them are relevant.When I moved here I was 25 years old. I’m now 37.If I was the same person at 37 that I was at 25, I’d be disappointed in myself. I’ve experienced so much and those experiences have changed me.Relationships are the story of overlap. When you meet someone — a friend or a partner — or when you take a job, move to a city, or pick up a hobby, it’s an action that reflects an alignment of circumstances in your life. It’s the right time for that connection to happen. And yet you and whoever (or whatever) you’re in relationship with are both changing all the time in ways both big and small. Those changes accumulate and eventually you might wake up and realize you’re not the same person. That old sweater no longer fits you — maybe not literally, but it no longer feels right. That friendship takes more effort and each time you hang out interactions feel a little more stilted and forced. It’s time to let it go.If you continue to hold onto it there’s a gnawing friction — maybe guilt, maybe grief, maybe just a feeling of nagging discomfort — because you’re out of alignment. You’re acting out of habit. You’re refusing to accept the change that is happening. Change will happen regardless of your attempts to stop or control it. You’re choosing to remain stuck — and choosing not to be open to new things that will enter your life if you let old things go.There is no judgment in changing or letting go. There is no fault or blame. There is no good or bad. It’s just acceptance of what is. It’s the failure to accept change that leads to suffering.Since moving to the Bay I’ve gotten married and divorced. I’ve raised a puppy. I’ve had a half dozen jobs. Friends have come and gone. Some friends have passed before their time, by their own choice or not. Some have had kids. Others have had cancer. A few have had both.I’ve survived a global pandemic. I’ve picked up new hobbies and let others go. My body has transformed: I’ve trained it, injured it, modified it, and healed it.I’ve built and raced several cars, ridden a motorcycle to Burning Man, danced until dawn at underground raves, and sang at the top of my lungs, soaked in sweat seeing my favorite bands perform. I’ve worked out so hard I had trouble stringing together coherent sentences. I’ve made art, played music, watched a meteor shower on a mountaintop with someone I loved, road tripped through the desert, encountered anteaters in the central American jungle, and swam naked in the moonlight in Puerto Rico.I’ve had my heart broken so badly I thought I’d never feel happiness again. I’ve gone to therapy, stopped going to therapy, started going to therapy again, and started doing psychedelic-assisted therapy.All of this has been possible because of the life I created in San Francisco. Had I not moved here over a decade ago many of those things would not have happened. (Naturally, another set of things would have taken their place; yet I do not grieve for not having experienced them.) San Francisco made so much available to me, things that were unique to being here in this decade of my life and at this moment in time, and I gave so much back to it. San Francisco changed my life, and for that I will always be grateful.And yet that does not create an obligation. As my former wife once told me, a relationship is not a death pact. Or, in the words we would both use now: attachment is the root of suffering. Choosing to stay in this city — remaining attached to the life I created here — would be denying change, choosing to foster the conditions for my own unhappiness, creating my own suffering. Living here, in the life I have created with its habits and patterns and quirks and opportunities, is no longer right for who I am. So I am releasing myself from it.I am not blaming the city. I think we do ourselves a disservice by placing agency for our actions outside of ourselves. Our paths converged, intertwined, and are now diverging. It’s okay. Life goes on, just in different directions.Nothing is permanent: those paths might yet intersect later, as Brian and I found out many years ago. By letting go, I am allowing for my own change, growth, and flourishing. Maybe I’ll return, and if I do it will be as a better, more fully-realized version of myself; and it will be because I am once again able to wholeheartedly commit to, celebrate, and contribute to this city’s unique vibrancy. Letting go is sometimes necessary for growth. It is an act of love both for ourselves and for those with whom we are in relation.Sometimes love is not grinding it out, forcing yourself to continue down a specific path, grasping tightly to what you “should” do. Sometimes love is allowing for space so that each of you has room to blossom in the way you need. Sometimes love is thanking your partner and letting go.So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Now it ends as it began: staying at a friend’s place, balanced on that golden thread between what is and what might be, holding it all lightly.'], ['Amusing Ourselves to Death in the Attention Economy', 'Brad Stulberg', 'Oct 20', 'https://bstulberg.medium.com/amusing-ourselves-to-death-in-the-attention-economy-b5c84cae6a07?source=home---------114------------------0----------', 'Recently at the gas station, I was filling up my tank as a beautiful woman appeared on the high-definition screen placed on the pump.

You radiate blue-green after acing that pop quiz. Overwhelmed, your head shifts to red, orange, and purple. While confronting fear, your whole-body swirls yellow-orange. How would that impact the way you understood your emotions and those of others? Meet Feelings Monster, a furry character that lives within the educational app Microsoft Reflect.Through color, body language, emojis, and verbal definitions, Feelings Monster provides access points to begin identifying one’s emotional patterns. And during the pandemic, when teachers were struggling to emotionally connect with their students, this little critter became more than just a cute face.The Feelings Monster is a teacher’s aid for applying Social Emotional Learning (SEL). The method is becoming popular in classrooms across the world as people recognize that “soft” skills (empathy, self-awareness, communication, etc.) aren’t so soft. We aren’t machines that just show up at school or work and produce; we have complex emotional landscapes that impact our ability to stay motivated, be resilient in the face of adversity, form strong relationships, and create a sense of self.Designing for Mental Health\\nEmotions impact everything: your health, decision making, relationships, and self-esteem. They also impact how you learn. Since the 1960’s, research has shown a distinct correlation between a child’s feelings and their academic performance. But emotions can be hard to identify, understand, and express.The pursuit of mental health and self-awareness is challenging. While it is often presented as achievable for everyone, many people don’t have the time, resources, or sense of safety they need to begin taking mental health steps independently. And anxiety around asking for help adds another layer of difficulty. “It’s hard to tell your teacher, ‘I’m overwhelmed’ when you don’t know what overwhelmed looks like,” said Principal Product Manager Elad Graiver.In early iterations of Microsoft Reflect, students were asked to choose words that identified how they felt. The problem was that children did not always understand the full meaning of the words they had to choose from to identify their emotions. Their difficult experience of choosing the right words reinforced their hesitation to share their feelings.The product design team then added emoji that helped students categorize their emotions and identify their feelings. With emoji, the team recognized that nuance was limited. For students to develop comprehensive communication skills, they needed support learning to express a breadth of emotions. The team got pregnant with the idea of creating a character. Soon they’d give birth to Feelings Monster.(Re)searching for the perfect emotional avatar\\nA multi-disciplinary design team of visual designers, researchers, and content designers came together to hone both the product and the character. The team had to ask for very sensitive information from society’s most vulnerable people: children, teens, and young adults, who were also the team’s collaborators.This character had to express the students’ deepest expressions and emotions. That’s a lot to expect from an illustrated character. Most importantly, “We were asking students to see this character as themselves,” said Principal Design Manager & Researcher Abigail Steinem.Steinem interviewed students from around the globe to gage their response to the design team’s character mockups. Either the avatar would be a person or a humanoid, the team thought, but the students who would use the avatar had other ideas (as they usually do).From gaming consoles to productivity software, we bring a human centered lens to our work, though applying those same principles to art and illustration was a unique process. If expression of self is the incarnation of emotions and mental health, then how do you create a single avatar that successfully expresses millions of young people’s emotions, in just about every country on the planet?Conjuring the Feelings Monster: the creative process\\n“We were looking for really big expressive elements,” said Creative Director Alberto Cerriteno. He was doing quick, iterative pencil sketches that Steinem and Senior Product Designer Yonatan Turkin then showed to students, asking if the drawing expressed an emotion that they identified with. The team’s research taught Cerriteno that accentuating the eyes, mouth, and hands were the crucial elements to conveying human emotion and specific feelings, but some of the students’ feedback led to unexpected places.“Nobody was prepared for this,” said Senior Designer Felipe Medina Contreras. The students would prompt unforeseen questions like should the avatar’s hands have fingers or just a thumb? Without one or the other, the hands look like fists. If they were going to have fingers, they couldn’t have four. In Japan, that could be a reference to Yakuza or the mafia. And what about irises? Who would’ve thought about the importance of eyebrows? Their absence disabled the avatar from telegraphing thoughts to other minds. Now, imagine, after all of that, the team still needed to figure out what The Feelings Monster would actually look like?From Contreras’ initial iterations, the design team discovered that the character couldn’t be human. “That was our first wrong idea,” he said. Students associated colors and human shapes with specific races and genders, which undercut the goal of truly empowering everyone with this creature. By trial and error, they learned that the character’s physical features didn’t have to be as complicated as an actual person. The character had to be androgynous. They didn’t need clothes. Their facial features had to be refined, not oversimplified. Still, the character had to be nimble — versatile.The students didn’t want robots, either. Designing an abstract character became the team’s new focus. “‘We need whatever it is you’re making to feel tactile, to feel fuzzy, to feel warm, to feel like I can trust it to accurately express me,’” the students told Steinem. They wanted lively colors to reveal their vibrant inner world. And out of all of this, the round and soft Feelings Monster was born. The color changing character made friends with young adults and college students, too. “We found out that the generation of children who grew up on Pixar movies had no problem embracing furry monsters to express their feelings as adults,” said Turkin.Multi-dimensional magic\\nWanting to push the visual element even further, the team explored how to make the experience multi-dimensional. The Feelings Monster now ultimately exists in multiple realities as an illustration, a cartoon, and a live-action puppet.As a cartoon, Feelings Monster helps students release tension and anxiety through guided breathing and movement. In puppet form, videos of Feelings Monster navigating their emotional world help normalize uncomfortable emotions and model healthy coping skills. As an illustration, the Feelings Monster represents over 50 nuanced words that can be selected to describe students’ feelings.Content Designer Tany Holzworth helped further bring The Feelings Monster to life by adding depth and character development. Brought into the physical world in puppet form, Feelings Monster (who goes by the pronouns they/them) works with friends to demonstrate their coping skills and normalize emotional expression. “They’re a sensitive soul. They love plants, tend to talk a bit too fast, and live with their aunt. Giving them a little backstory helped me to think through what they might say and how they might act when faced with a challenging emotion,” Holzworth said.Educators sometimes use fun physical activities to break up their lessons, sharpening children’s focus while improving their test scores and building a fun school environment. To support educators in leading these brain breaks, an animated Feelings Monster dances, meditates, and does yoga. Soon, when this feature is available, students will get to choose among the three.Technical Art Director Rudy Vessup said that he watched videos of children dancing to make the creature mirror the way children move. “I had to keep their movements simple and fluid, but natural,” said Vessup. The Feelings Monster instructs the class to bust-a-move.Physical movement also creates something that students often don’t feel enough of: autonomy. They’re in control of their movements and the importance of personal agency applies to product design as well. Students are often aware of the world’s problems but seldom enlisted in creating solutions.Similarly, they aren’t as often consulted in the creation of the tools they use, and it was important to the team behind Feelings Monster to buck this trend. Student input informed every stage of Microsoft Reflect and Feelings Monster’s development, which gave the students agency about how they wanted to express themselves through our products.Around the world, young people are navigating a complicated and sometimes cruel environment. They need someone relatable who can provide a safe space for practicing their coping skills. Adding Feelings Monster to SEL practices can help educators provide that role model, a soft, fuzzy one that reduces barriers to engagement — like talking to your teacher directly. We hope that Feelings Monster will continue to make both students and educators feel more informed and supported in sharing their emotions.To stay in the know with Microsoft Design, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, or join our Windows or Office Insider program.
