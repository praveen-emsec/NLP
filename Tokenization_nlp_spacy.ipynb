fallacies aim avoid beingmisled following list fallacies intended beexhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal force appeal force committed arguer resorts force thethreat force order try push acceptance conclusion itis often used politicians summarized might makes right force threatened need direct threat arguer example thus ample proof truth bible whorefuse accept truth burn hell argumentum ad hominemargumentum ad hominem literally argument directed man abusive variety argumentum ad hominem occurs instead tryingto disprove truth assertion arguer attacks person orpeople making assertion

ignorantiumargumentum ad ignorantium means argument ignorance fallacyoccurs whenever argued something must true simply ithas proved false equivalently argued thatsomething must false proved true note thisis assuming something false provedtrue basic scientific principle examples course bible true nobody prove otherwise course telepathy psychic phenomena exist nobody hasshown proof real note fallacy apply court law one isgenerally assumed innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation known event would producecertain evidence occurred absence evidence validly used infer event occur example flood described bible would require enormous volume waterto present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice poles therefore nosuch flood occurred science validly assume lack evidence something hasnot occurred cannot conclude certainty occurred however argumentum ad misericordiamthis appeal pity also known special pleading fallacy committed arguer appeals pity sake getting

generalization dicto simplicitera sweeping generalization occurs general rule applied aparticular situation features particular situationrender rule inapplicable sweeping generalization opposite ahasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hocthese known false cause fallacies fallacy non causa pro causa occurs one identifies something thecause event actually shown cause example took aspirin prayed god headache disappeared godcured headache fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs something assumed tobe cause event merely happened event example soviet union collapsed taking atheism therefore must avoidatheism reasons cum hoc ergo propter hocthis fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts thatbecause two events occur together must causally related leavesno room factors may cause events petitio principiithis fallacy occurs premises least questionable theconclusion reached circulus demonstrandothis fallacy occurs one assumes premise conclusion onewishes reach often proposition rephrased thefallacy appears valid argument example homosexuals must allowed hold government office hence anygovernment official revealed homosexual lose job therefore homosexuals anything hide secret opento blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold governmentoffice note argument entirely circular premise conclusion argument like actually cited reasonfor british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example classic know god exists bible tells us know thebible true word god complex question fallacy interrogationthis fallacy presupposition one example classic loaded question stopped beating wife question presupposes definite answer another question noteven asked trick often used lawyers cross examination ask questions like hide money stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions long ec interference affairs allowed continue chancellor plan two years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchithe fallacy

something must apply whole example bicycle made entirely low mass components therefore lightweight fallacy composition conclude property numberof individual items shared collection items example car uses less petrol causes less pollution bus therefore carsare less environmentally damaging buses fallacy divisionthe fallacy division opposite fallacy composition likeits opposite exists two varieties first assume aproperty thing must apply parts example studying rich college therefore must rich assume property collection items shared byeach item example ants destroy tree therefore ant destroy tree slippery slope argumentthis argument states one event occur harmfulevents proof made harmful events caused thefirst event example legalize marijuana would legalize crack heroinand nation full drug

based upon faith bible also form ofhistory islam based faith christianity based faith islam aform christianity cats form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form ofanimal based carbon chemistry dogs form cat affirmation consequentthis fallacy argument form implies b b true therefore ais true understand fallacy examine truth table forimplication given earlier denial antecedentthis fallacy argument
